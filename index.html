                    <summary><b>Seeya</b> - Deadmau5</summary>
                    <p>I can't say I'm much of a Nintendo fan, but one time in 2014 I was waiting, for some reason, for one of their Direct streams to start on Youtube, and they had some music playing on the stream before the event started. This song came up, and I was instantly charmed by the groovy bass and magical vocals. Some time later, I started learning to play the bass and this was one of the first songs I wanted to learn; it's quite simple, but incredibly catchy and fun to listen to and jam to.</p>
                    <p>That's where my contact with Deadmau5 ended until a year later, when I met the guy from London whom I dated for a little while. He was a big fan of the artist, and through his influence I went on to discover a few more tracks I enjoyed, totalling 6 tracks = 2 from 3 different albums, being one instrumental and one with vocals. It's a neat kind of symmetry!</p>
                    <p>Sadly, it's a well-known fact that this artist is a dick. This knowledge kind of spoils the music, but sometimes I still allow myself to vibe to it. I probably had Superliminal on the background for a while during my weed-fuelled website building frenzy!</p>

                    <summary><b>Mitternacht</b> - E Nomine</summary>
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago I talked about Megaherz, so now it's time to present the other group I discovered through those Hetalia videos. The song used was Exitus, which is still one of my faves due to its ambiance and exquisitely neocore lyrics; but it was Mitternacht, the first track in the album Finsternis and one of their most popular songs, that really got my attention.</p>
                    <p>E Nomine has a pretty unique concept, using dark-sounding trance music, Gregorian chants (in sometimes broken Latin) and German vocals by famous synchros to bring the occult, the supernatural and the unholy to life. Over the years since I first discovered them in 2010, I've had a few moments where I revisited the group's repertoire, each time finding more and more tracks to save to my library.</p>
                    <p>The last time I did, I ended up giving the whole album Finsternis a listen through from start to finish. Each track is preceded by an introduction, creating a more or less seamless, almost cinematic experience! Some songs are livelier while others are more somber, so there's something for everyone!</p>

          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
          <p><b>22/08/2024</b>: Biiig update! I've moved the entire website from Neocities to Github, and acquired a shiny custom domain! While I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the old internet revival community, I decided that I really wanted the custom domain, and it just wasn't going to be viable on Neocities. With that said, everything else is staying the exact same way! I've also done some minor changes to text in various places, and added a recent drawing to Harrow's page.</p>
          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
