                    <summary><b>Nakts karalis</b> - Laika Suns</summary>
                    <p>During a time when I was most interested in the Latvian language, close to ten years ago, I somehow came across this song, whose title means "night king", which has stuck with me since then.</p>
                    <p>As I've made clear in previous features, I'm always fond of basslines that carry a song regardless of their complexity, and this one is no exception; the bass is the first thing you hear, and it never stops laying the foundation for the vocals and guitars to shine in their own ways. For the first half, the bass sets an uneasy feeling with a repetitive groove, staccato notes accompanying the drumbeat with precision; but after the halfway mark, it shifts into a continuous pattern propelling the ensemble forward, sending it hurtling into the starkly punctuated and abrupt ending.</p>
                    <p>I've always enjoyed the song's dark tone and what little I could understand of the lyrics through machine translation. Right now it's impossible to find the text, but I remember tweeting a line that I particularly liked, "Par savas karaļvalsts Karali mani sauc", and some time later getting a reply from one of the band members offering his best translation! The reply no longer exists, but I think it was something like "call me the king of my kingdom", and in the song's context, it sounds so cool.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Super Psycho Love</b> - Simon Curtis</summary>
                    <p>My pet playlist has been in continuous evolution for a whole decade, with new songs being added every now and then. Most selections come from my music repertoire, but some were suggestions from my friend who understood the assignment from the beginning; this song was one of her recommendations, back in 2019.</p>
                    <p>There are two versions of it, the original being darker and this one more upbeat, but that one wasn't released officially in HQ at the time, so the version that stuck was this remix. Regardless, the lyrics made it an obligatory addition to the playlist. What's more interesting though is that the timing of discovering this song coincided with my short-term spreadsheet internship; our small team worked in the office with our own laptops and we had freedom to work however we felt was best for us. For me, I quickly found out that blasting this song on my headphones put me in an almost hypnotised state, and I got so much work done under its influence ahahaha. I truly was listening to it on loop, not just at work but also on the metro ride back home.</p>
                    <p>Both versions are now available on Spotify, but sadly this remix isn't on Apple Music for some reason. The original is very good too, with an arrangement that's even more fitting to the lyrics's obsessive, controlling themes, but the remix will always take me back to the fun times I had working my first real job.</p>

            <p><b>31/12/2024</b>: Front page update! It's the last day of the year, and I'm super glad I've been able to keep working on the website for more than 40 weeks now! Some weeks were busier than others, but I never thought of giving up. 2025 will be an interesting year with all the preparations for the next step in my life, so let's hope everything works out.</p>
            <p><b>24/12/2024</b>: Happy holidays from Québec! Been having a great time in the cold and we just had some snowfall. Christmas season is always busy but I had the strength to put out a new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
            <p><b>26/11/2024</b>: Weekly update is here! Since the last changelog I did some changes on Neo's page and also on the front page, putting the new commi at the top and moving the previous image to the bottom.</p>
            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
