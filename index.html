            <p><b>29/01/2025</b>: I can't believe the month is almost over! Front page update is here, with a twist: I've decided on a whim that from now on I will no longer be writing music comments. They just take an enormous amount of energy to write, and I kinda just wanna keep sharing my fave songs without worrying about the little blurb.</p>
            <p><b>22/01/2025</b>: Front page update! I've been too lazy to write up new music comments.</p>
            <p><b>18/01/2025</b>: I've just published a new blog post I've been working on, and also a whole new page! It isn't finished yet, but since I mistakenly left it in on one of my recent pushes, I decided to go for it; I'll finish it at some point!</p>
            <p><b>15/01/2025</b>: It's a day late but here's update! We had a lovely time in Québec and took lots of nice photos. I didn't feel like writing new music comments this week, as my mind is taken over by something very important: we're getting a cat tonight!!</p>
            <p><b>07/01/2025</b>: My birthday is tomorrow, so this is a special update! As a birthday indulgence, I have decided to finally break the rule of no repeating music artist in order to feature some of my favourite groups again. My prayers for snow in time for my bday were answered, and we are spending the weekend in Québec City, so I'm quite looking forward to that!</p>
            <p><b>31/12/2024</b>: Front page update! It's the last day of the year, and I'm super glad I've been able to keep working on the website for more than 40 weeks now! Some weeks were busier than others, but I never thought of giving up. 2025 will be an interesting year with all the preparations for the next step in my life, so let's hope everything works out.</p>
            <p><b>24/12/2024</b>: Happy holidays from Québec! Been having a great time in the cold and we just had some snowfall. Christmas season is always busy but I had the strength to put out a new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
