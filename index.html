                    <summary><b>Skulls</b> - Bastille</summary>
                    <p>I can't believe I haven't yet featured Bastille in here, but maybe it's because I talked briefly about them on a blog post about my long-running playlist. So here they are finally! I discovered Bastille a decade ago, when I was in high school and my music taste was thus far basically just metal and metalcore. Though I had probably heard Pompeii at some point, it was their new single bad news that got me hooked, and me and my best friend were positively obsessed with the band.</p>
                    <p>I consider All This Bad Blood, the extended edition of their first album, a masterpiece. While the base album is already really good, the extra tracks contain some brilliant lesser-known gems, and this song is one of them, a track that is rarely talked about and performed live. Fun fact, I saw them at Lollapalooza 2015, and it was my first music festival!</p>
                    <p>Back then, Bastille's music was a lot more indie and had, in my opinion, more soul than their more recent releases. Their lyrics were filled with references and poetic allusions, and the instrumental + vocals weren't as overproduced and catered to mainstream radio play. I've been listening to their old stuff from nostalgia and their status as one of my big fave bands at the time was completely justified.</p>

                    <summary><b>Save Me</b> - Muse</summary>
                    <p>Muse is another one of those bands that's always been present in my life, ever since I discovered them through, you guessed it, the first Twilight film. Over the years I would occasionally discover a few more tracks by them, but I never succeeded in becoming a Muse fan as I tried at one point in my teenage years.</p>
                    <p>My partner, on the other hand, would probably consider himself a big fan of the band and has made me listen to a lot of their music, and it's kind of 50/50 whether I like it or not. But this song was a pleasant surprise: I heard it the first time while we were driving back from our first trip to Québec City on a rainy afternoon. It's written and sung by the band's bassist (a welcome departure from Matt's vocals that, while generally great, can be sometimes overbearing), and the repetitive, monotone vocals and bassline are another example of this newfound appreciation of mine.</p>
                    <p>Even though it is a way more recent find than most of the Muse music in my library, it very quickly became one of my favourites. I still don't find all of their music that appealing to me, but I'm glad I found this charming little outlier.</p>

            <p><b>22/01/2025</b>: Front page update! I've been too lazy to write up new music comments.</p>
            <p><b>18/01/2025</b>: I've just published a new blog post I've been working on, and also a whole new page! It isn't finished yet, but since I mistakenly left it in on one of my recent pushes, I decided to go for it; I'll finish it at some point!</p>
            <p><b>15/01/2025</b>: It's a day late but here's update! We had a lovely time in Québec and took lots of nice photos. I didn't feel like writing new music comments this week, as my mind is taken over by something very important: we're getting a cat tonight!!</p>
            <p><b>07/01/2025</b>: My birthday is tomorrow, so this is a special update! As a birthday indulgence, I have decided to finally break the rule of no repeating music artist in order to feature some of my favourite groups again. My prayers for snow in time for my bday were answered, and we are spending the weekend in Québec City, so I'm quite looking forward to that!</p>
            <p><b>31/12/2024</b>: Front page update! It's the last day of the year, and I'm super glad I've been able to keep working on the website for more than 40 weeks now! Some weeks were busier than others, but I never thought of giving up. 2025 will be an interesting year with all the preparations for the next step in my life, so let's hope everything works out.</p>
            <p><b>24/12/2024</b>: Happy holidays from Québec! Been having a great time in the cold and we just had some snowfall. Christmas season is always busy but I had the strength to put out a new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
