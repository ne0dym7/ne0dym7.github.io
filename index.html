                    <summary><b>What You Know</b> - Two Door Cinema Club</summary>
                    <p>While I'm not entirely sure how I came about this song in early 2015, I can say for certain this Northern Irish band soon became one of the key artists of my growing "indie rock/pop" taste. I quite enjoyed more than a few tracks from both their released albums at that time, but this one is extra special because it played an important role in my amateur musician career!</p>
                    <p>As mentioned in previous entries, I started going to a music school in 2015 to learn the bass. After a few months of studying under the owner of the school who was a rather traditional instructor, another teacher took over my lessons, and this one was a much cooler guy. He would always encourage me to bring my own favourite songs for us to use as a basis for our lessons, and he eventually asked if I wanted to join a band with other students from the school. Our repertoire consisted of a few medleys of Brazilian and English-language songs, a French jazz-y song, and What You Know, which was my suggestion!</p>
                    <p>It fit really well with the rest of their existing setlist and it had a pretty fun bassline, like a lot of TDCC's songs. We did 3 live performances as a group and this one was always my favourite to play, though I was a little biased, haha.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>The Ghost of You</b> - My Chemical Romance</summary>
                    <p>I was introduced to MCR via tumblr, but I never really considered myself a fan. I knew a handful of tracks from The Black Parade and the first one out of their last album, but this sample size didn't appeal to me enough to make me look for more.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward until the middle of the pandemic, when I discovered this song and the big hit off "Three Cheers", Helena. At a time in my life when I began to accept my past and present edginess and emoness in the same manner a Persona character accepts their Shadow self, those two songs really resonated with me in a way their subsequent releases did not. This track especially was on repeat for several days; while Helena already starts high-energy with a barrage of drumbeats and anthemic lyrics, The Ghost of You has a mellow verse supported by the bass and a soft guitar, that suddenly explodes into a heartwrenching chorus — I especially love Gerard's vocals in "At the end of the world or the last thing I see...".</p>
                    <p>I did check out the rest of this album hoping that it would outdo The Black Parade in number of saved songs in my library, but unfortunately it didn't, despite the fact that I definitely vibe with its sound more. Maybe if I give it another listen through?</p>

          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
          <p><b>22/08/2024</b>: Biiig update! I've moved the entire website from Neocities to Github, and acquired a shiny custom domain! While I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the old internet revival community, I decided that I really wanted the custom domain, and it just wasn't going to be viable on Neocities. With that said, everything else is staying the exact same way! I've also done some minor changes to text in various places, and added a recent drawing to Harrow's page.</p>
          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
