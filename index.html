                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Abrace Sua Sombra</b> - Fresno</summary>
                    <p>The fact that only one other Brazilian artist made it into this section prior to now is a testament to how little I engage with my country's musical scene. However, my discovery of Fresno in 2019 shook up my conception of what Brazilian music could be in a very positive way.</p>
                    <p>Or rather rediscovery, as the band's name was always floating around during my childhood, although with them being a self-professed emo band, it wasn't always in a good light (it was just "cool" to hate on emo back then). So I went my whole life never having heard a song by this group, until one evening when I was browsing reddit and saw a Tip Of My Tongue post that I felt compelled to solve. The poster was looking for a BR album with a red cover and that search took me to Fresno's 2016 concept album. It turned out to be not the answer to the TOMT, but to my itch for new music to love!</p>
                    <p>Listening through the entire album, sober or high, was a mindblowing experience, not just for the songs themselves but also the mere idea of accidentally stumbling upon the finest Brazilian rock I'd heard. Even my music teacher at the time was pleasantly surprised by the quality of music put out by a band that most had only ever sneered at.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>The Kids Aren't Alright</b> - Fall Out Boy</summary>
                    <p>I first discovered FOB on tumblr in 2011 with "Thnks Fr Th Mmrs", and since then they've been another band whose presence in my library has been a constant and steadily growing with the years. With my increased interest in emo music nowadays I should definitely check out their first few albums, before they switched to a more pop rock sound with Save Rock and Roll.</p>
                    <p>Yet the bulk of my FOB library is from their latter era, and the catalyst for that was the film Big Hero 6 which featured an early version of a track that would be in their upcoming album AB/AP. I was so excited for it that I got my friend to buy it on iTunes for my birthday (along with Enter Shikari's The Mindsweep which came out at the same time). Out of all the tracks in the album this one always stuck with me the most and that's why I picked it for the feature.</p>
                    <p>From the bass-led harmony and catchy whistle tune, to the emotional vocals and bittersweet lyrics, to all the texture details like little piano notes and hand clap percussion, this song floods me with nostalgia for 2015, my last year of high school and the end of a chapter in my life.</p>

          <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
          <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
          <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
          <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
          <p><b>13/10/2024</b>: Another sneaky update in the early hours of Monday, but still counts. Should be done with part 2 of my newest blog article soon! Also have a brand new page in the works!</p>
          <p><b>06/10/2024</b>: It's not Monday until I've slept, so this update is still on time haha! The dreaded French exam has gone, I got excellent results on the comprehension part and all I have to do is pray I got a good enough score in the expression tests. Hopefully I'll have a bit more time to work on this site for now! I also put up a new blog post that has a sequel incoming at some point!</p>
          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
