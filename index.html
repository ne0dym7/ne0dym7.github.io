                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>My Turn to Evil</b> - Letters VS. Numbers</summary>
                    <p>2011 was the year I started using tumblr and getting into fandoms, with Doctor Who (NewWho) being the most important of them. David Tennant was always extremely popular and his Doctor was my favourite, so naturally everyone including myself was fangirling over a new movie where he starred as a sexy retired vampire hunter: Fright Night.</p>
                    <p>This strange song by a group that seemingly doesn't really exist was featured in the trailer for said film, which I never saw, but the track stuck with me so much that it's held a spot in my library all these years. The first minute sets the mood with a thundercrack, arpeggios on an acoustic guitar and a harmonising, sinister-sounding vocalisation; more instruments then join the escalating storm of sonic disquiet before it all comes to halt and only the singer speaks, reciting the lyrics like an omen or a curse. With its neocore lyrics and dark sound, it's a track that has aged like wine to me, proving that bangers can come from anywhere.</p>
                    <p>I heard the movie it promoted is actually kind of good, so maybe I'll watch it at some point?</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Colony Collapse</b> - Architects</summary>
                    <p>I have no memory of listening to Architects during my metalcore days in 2013, but my archives reveal not only that I did but also that I enjoyed them. Well, at that time I was listening to a lot of bands in that genre and not all of them stuck, I guess.</p>
                    <p>Then in 2019 while playing videogames I suddenly felt in the mood to listen to metalcore; it had become a sort of guilty pleasure as I'd grown out of the genre, and putting on a Spotify playlist I was indeed met not just with some nostalgic tunes but also some junk too. "Broken Cross" by Architects was one of the few good tracks that caught my attention enough to make it into my library. This exact scenario repeated in 2023, introducing me to yet another track from the same album (this one), and it hit different. While the former song was blasphemous anger incarnate, Colony Collapse is a desperate elegy to the environment and our species, explicitly written about the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster but applicable today to so many matters.</p>
                    <p>The singer's clean vocals and screams drip with sorrow and regret, while the instrumentals mixing heavy guitars with synthesised strings enhance the poignant message with moments of calm and catharsis. Maybe I should check out more of their music, they seem like a diamond in the metalcore rough.</p>

            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
