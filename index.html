                    <summary><b>#1 Crush</b> - Garbage</summary>
                    <p>Considering my super old pet playlist that I've written about in my blog, it's surprising that I'd never known about this song until very recently. My only previous contact with this band was through their hit "The World is not Enough" (which already had a spot in my playlist), but it was only thanks to a reddit comment that I discovered this song.</p>
                    <p>The commenter in question recalled an occasion when they chose Number 1 Crush as a soundtrack for a lap dance, posting under a thread about the movie Romeo + Juliet, which apparently included this song in its OST. (Coincidentally, I just had that film featured here! I didn't know until now that this song had a relation to the film, nor did I remember the exact context of the reddit comment that led me to it.) Somehow, that comment along with others claiming it was the "sexiest song ever" made me curious enough to check it out, and they were definitely right: the lyrics, dripping with violent obsession and corruption, are incredibly neocore and fit so perfectly in my playlist that I couldn't believe I'd never heard the track before.</p>
                    <p>The provocative lyrics are at first carried by a mesmerising bassline and a very trip-hop sounding drum loop, with the big highlight, the famous "gated reverb snare" (a term I learned thanks to comments about this song), kicking in at about 1:25. But I find the next verse after the chorus, with an even more aggressive percussion and rapidly escalating lyrics, the most addictive part of the song, which I can't help but play on loop every time.</p>

                    <summary><b>Apparitions</b> - Matthew Good Band</summary>
                    <p>I don't know why it has taken me this long to put this song in my little music corner, cuz even though it was a recent addition to my library it instantly became one of my most played tracks at the time of discovery.</p>
                    <p>In August of 2022, on the occasion of my first trip to Québec, we were having a family supper one day when my partner's father started chatting with me about music and asked me to put on some Brazilian music I enjoyed. He, being more than a little tipsy, thought that one artist I played sounded like a Canadian group he liked, and thus I was introduced to this song. (I could kind of see where he was coming from, but I think his rec was much better than mine.) After supper I looked up the song he showed me, and it became the soundtrack for the rest of my trip, including my emotionally overwhelming departure at the airport.</p>
                    <p>Starting with a soft acoustic guitar-led intro and single bass notes, the energy picks up with the addition of drums and a simple but impactful bassline, as well as increasingly assertive vocals. There's something so haunting and bittersweet about the lyrics, in a way I can feel more than I can explain, especially my favourite line: "The rat in your brain rules the world...".</p>

          <p><b>13/10/2024</b>: Another sneaky update in the early hours of Monday, but still counts. Should be done with part 2 of my newest blog article soon! Also have a brand new page in the works!</p>
          <p><b>06/10/2024</b>: It's not Monday until I've slept, so this update is still on time haha! The dreaded French exam has gone, I got excellent results on the comprehension part and all I have to do is pray I got a good enough score in the expression tests. Hopefully I'll have a bit more time to work on this site for now! I also put up a new blog post that has a sequel incoming at some point!</p>
          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
