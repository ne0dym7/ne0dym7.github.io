                    <summary><b>La Fin Du Show</b> - Les Cowboys Fringants</summary>
                    <p>I featured a song by the beloved Québécois folk-rock band on the fourth weekly update of this website. Mere days after the update, the band released a surprise new studio album, Pub Royal, containing songs written for the musical of same name as well as brand new tracks. Hearing Karl's unforgettable voice again touched the hearts of the entire francophonie.</p>
                    <p>While this poignant 7-minute epic was one of those that first appeared in the musical Pub Royal, it is obviously meant to be a tribute to Karl. There is a clip of him recording the vocals for this song that is heart-wrenching: just imagine having cancer, weakened and knowing you don't have much time left, yet singing with the same strength and charisma as always. And imagine being his bandmates, finishing the track after his passing and putting together a touching music video to celebrate his life and legacy. The song has this air of triumphant resignation, celebrating his success in life, lamenting the illness that has cut it short, and finally accepting that this is it, nothing lies beyond: "Qu'elle soit extra ou ordinaire/Chaque vie finit d'la même manière/C'est c'qui arrive à la fin du show".</p>
                    <p>I saw Les Cowboys live as a birthday gift on Jan 6 2023, and on Jan 4 2025 we got to see the musical. It was an amazing experience, with an excellent selection of the band's best songs performed by great actors, adapted to tell a story that was equal parts fun and depressing, which is just what I love about Les Cowboys's music. La fin du show was the climax of the spectacle and they did a great job: as the curtains came down behind the actor at the end of the song as he walked off the stage, it was like saying goodbye to Karl himself.</p>

                    <summary><b>Deutschland</b> - Rammstein</summary>
                    <p>When I sold my soul to Rammstein in 2012, I was met with a fairly static discography: their latest studio album had come out 3 years before and few new songs were released since then. They continued touring the world, dropping the occasional compilation or concert movie, but the idea of a new Rammstein album was a distant dream.</p>
                    <p>So when they announced in 2019 their newest album after a whole decade, it was a bit like the Second Coming. It wouldn't have been a proper Rammstein release without some controversy though: the music video for Deutschland, the opening track and first to be revealed, was an epic 9-minute short film depicting different eras of German history, with all the shocking imagery that entails (which invited many people to completely miss the point of the video and the song). It is an incredible clip that deserves a careful watch to take in all the little details in narrative, cinematography, costuming and special effects.</p>
                    <p>Deutschland is, to me, a quintessential Rammstein song and one of their greatest works, exploring the band's feelings towards their country's legacy while also referencing their own history as a group. The production is absolutely stellar, with the highlight being the guitar and synth riff that permeates the entire song, which is in my opinion their single best melody. I admit I am not as familiar with the latest two albums by Rammstein than I am with their first six, but I know this song will be a forever classic, a perfect distillation of their essence.</p>

            <p><b>07/01/2025</b>: My birthday is tomorrow, so this is a special update! As a birthday indulgence, I have decided to finally break the rule of no repeating music artist in order to feature some of my favourite groups again. My prayers for snow in time for my bday were answered, and we are spending the weekend in Québec City, so I'm quite looking forward to that!</p>
            <p><b>31/12/2024</b>: Front page update! It's the last day of the year, and I'm super glad I've been able to keep working on the website for more than 40 weeks now! Some weeks were busier than others, but I never thought of giving up. 2025 will be an interesting year with all the preparations for the next step in my life, so let's hope everything works out.</p>
            <p><b>24/12/2024</b>: Happy holidays from Québec! Been having a great time in the cold and we just had some snowfall. Christmas season is always busy but I had the strength to put out a new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
