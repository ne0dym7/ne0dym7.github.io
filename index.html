                    <summary><b>Cha Cha Cha</b> - Käärijä</summary>
                    <p>In every Eurovision at least one artist will inevitably become the fan favourite with their song, performance, and charisma, yet have their win tragically "stolen" by a less popular entry or through unexpected voting patterns, a result that only ends up boosting the artist's appeal with the public. In 2023, Finland's contestant became this figure, placing second but undoubtedly winning in everyone's hearts.</p>
                    <p>My partner happened to be in Brazil when the Grand Final was happening, that being a year I hadn't kept up with the contest prior to the main event itself. We learned that the Final was on, so we turned on the stream, rewinded back to the beginning and watched through the whole show. At that point, I had spoiled myself a little for some of the entries, including Finland's; I was the entire time looking out for the man with the dorky haircut, neon green sleeves and Rammstein tattoo. It was such a fun performance, and the song, equal parts industrial and hyperpop, was captivating. Even my sister was listening to it on loop!</p>
                    <p>Despite not winning that year, Käärijä got a ton of new fans (I myself watched a whole livestream of a show he did shortly after the ESC, and have enjoyed his previous and subsequent releases), a boost in his career, and certainly inspired many people to become interested in Finland by bringing a fun song in his native language, which is to me the best part of Eurovision.</p>

                    <summary><b>Vore</b> - Sleep Token</summary>
                    <p>It's always kind of funny to stumble upon something that's apparently super popular yet never having heard of it before. Such was the case with this band, which had completely escaped my knowledge until I heard "The Summoning" on some Spotify playlist.</p>
                    <p>It was a fine song (with a genre shift at the end which I don't enjoy) but after checking out more of their music, I concluded that I simply couldn't vibe with the metalcore-R&B fusion genre the group has captured a legion of rabid fans with, especially the weirdly autotuned vocals that I guess are supposed to give a sense of "otherwordly allure"; I'm sure the band's anonymous members are great artists, but it feels like a project engineered to trick certain demographics into thinking they like metalcore by mixing in softer genres, when they're actually just listening to pop with edgy lyrics and occasional distorted guitars and some rare screams. It's a little gatekeepy from me, but I don't get the same kind of metal-brain enjoyment from this band's work that I do from "real" metalcore etc bands.</p>
                    <p>The only other song I liked from what I heard of them was this one, and it's easy to see why: the bits with fry screamed vocals and the droning bass/synth/guitars are by themselves some of my favourite music I've heard, and I really wish I could find more like it! During the rest of the song, the overproduced clean vocals don't feel as offending as in other tracks as it never strays too far from the metal baseline it's built upon. In a universe where all of this group's music was like this, maybe I'd actually like them.</p>

            <p><b>24/12/2024</b>: Happy holidays from Québec! Been having a great time in the cold and we just had some snowfall. Christmas season is always busy but I had the strength to put out a new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
            <p><b>26/11/2024</b>: Weekly update is here! Since the last changelog I did some changes on Neo's page and also on the front page, putting the new commi at the top and moving the previous image to the bottom.</p>
            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
