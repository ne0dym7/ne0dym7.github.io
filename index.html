                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Same Mistake</b> - James Blunt</summary>
                    <p>Like many other tracks previously featured on my website, this song has accompanied me ever since my childhood. While researching to write this blurb, I found out the likely reason it became popular here was that it was featured in a telenovela, which would line up with the timeline.</p>
                    <p>And out of all songs I've already put in here, this might be the most generic folkish pop track, but it's still very dear to me. I don't really like the artist's other popular songs, but in this one I think his voice definitely fits the mellow atmosphere created by the lone acoustic guitar at the start, which is then joined by the piano, some electric guitar licks, and finally drums and bass. While the instrumentals have a rather cozy sound, the lyrics filled with melancholy, self-loathing and grief elevate the track to a timeless classic, in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>The lyrics are, in fact, a highlight of the song for me. Especially in the outro when all instruments come together and the singer goes "Look at the stars fall down and wonder where did I go wrong?"; having lived with many regrets now, this always makes my chest hurt.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Not Long For This World</b> - Slipknot</summary>
                    <p>Slipknot are a band I feel reluctant to support, considering how several members were fired or let go or screwed over. I have known them since before my conversion into a metalhead, though their music and stage personas intimidated/scared me. Once I became primed to enjoy metal music, the band was one of the obvious options on the menu, and thus I've followed them on and off for more than a decade.</p>
                    <p>Their first album since Gray's death, released in 2014, was my very first iTunes purchase, and I must have been fully hyped to have wanted to hear it ASAP. Now, I wasn't even that big into them anymore by the time they released their 2019 album, so I don't know what led me to also buy it on iTunes, but I guess I did. And I thought it was a fine release, although none of their albums have ever universally appealed to me.</p>
                    <p>This song was the standout for me and quickly became my favourite Slipknot track. It has a tasteful balance of softness and harshness, going from verses that evoke feelings of haziness and lightheadedness, to a captivatingly explosive chorus accompanied by the instruments in full force, then to a bridge marked by a barrage of aggressiveness, and then to my favourite bit: "The greatest conclusion that I ever had...", that always makes me rewind over and over and sing along. Regardless of how I feel about the band as an entity, this song earned a spot among some of my favourite tracks ever.</p>

          <p><b>06/10/2024</b>: It's not Monday until I've slept, so this update is still on time haha! The dreaded French exam has gone, I got excellent results on the comprehension part and all I have to do is pray I got a good enough score in the expression tests. Hopefully I'll have a bit more time to work on this site for now! I also put up a new blog post that has a sequel incoming at some point!</p>
          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
