            <p><b>09/04/2025</b>: Front page update! As for a real life update, tomorrow is my graduation ceremony, where I will officially be granted the title of Bachelor in Chemistry!</p>
            <p><b>02/04/2025</b>: Greetings from Brazil again! Getting back into FFXIV raiding has been fun, but otherwise I don't have much else going on. Update as usual though!</p>
            <p><b>26/03/2025</b>: This is a sad update, as it's the last one before I return to Brazil! I've been practically living in Canada for the past 3.5 months, and it's been a lot of fun but I kind of miss my stuff and family home.</p>
            <p><b>18/03/2025</b>: Based on the featured film count, we are at 52 films, which means this website is officially one year old! Hooray! I never expected I'd be able to keep up the hobby for this long, and granted my energy for it has gone up and down, but it's still great to reach such a milestone. Thanks to everyone's who's looked at my humble website, whoever you are!  Today I have brought a film I watched very recently that deeply moved me, and the first set of instrumental tracks in the featured music section.</p>
            <p><b>12/03/2025</b>: Update is late because I was super tired yesterday, but it's here! Exciting things have happened, as I was finally able to play with Jim and Athena again!</p>
            <p><b>04/03/2025</b>: Things are going a bit slow on my side, but front page update is here.</p>
            <p><b>25/02/2025</b>: Update as usual!</p>
            <p><b>18/02/2025</b>: Front page update, and a sorta QoL feature I'd been wanting to implement: splitting the music and movie pages! I thought since there are so many embeds, it would help loading times a little to split those long pages into smaller chunks.</p>
            <p><b>11/02/2025</b>: New update as usual; I haven't been super in the mood to play games or write lately, but this much I can do.</p>
            <p><b>04/02/2025</b>: Front page update is here!</p>
            <p><b>29/01/2025</b>: I can't believe the month is almost over! Front page update is here, with a twist: I've decided on a whim that from now on I will no longer be writing music comments. They just take an enormous amount of energy to write, and I kinda just wanna keep sharing my fave songs without worrying about the little blurb.</p>
            <p><b>22/01/2025</b>: Front page update! I've been too lazy to write up new music comments.</p>
            <p><b>18/01/2025</b>: I've just published a new blog post I've been working on, and also a whole new page! It isn't finished yet, but since I mistakenly left it in on one of my recent pushes, I decided to go for it; I'll finish it at some point!</p>
            <p><b>15/01/2025</b>: It's a day late but here's update! We had a lovely time in Québec and took lots of nice photos. I didn't feel like writing new music comments this week, as my mind is taken over by something very important: we're getting a cat tonight!!</p>
            <p><b>07/01/2025</b>: My birthday is tomorrow, so this is a special update! As a birthday indulgence, I have decided to finally break the rule of no repeating music artist in order to feature some of my favourite groups again. My prayers for snow in time for my bday were answered, and we are spending the weekend in Québec City, so I'm quite looking forward to that!</p>
