                    <summary><b>Passion</b> - Utada Hikaru</summary>
                    <p>I have a long and complex history with Kingdom Hearts: while I only fully got into this series in 2018, it has been present in my life in some way or another since my childhood. I couldn't find the opening version of Passion, the Japanese theme song of KH2, on Spotify, so I settled for the single version. Although the site does have the opening of Sanctuary (the English-language theme), it is the Japanese one that's accompanied me for around 15 years now.</p>
                    <p>I didn't know Hikari/Simple and Clean back then, so this song has always had my preference and I definitely find it the best opening song in KH. Everything about it is so perfect, I get so lost in its ethereal-sounding verses and the choruses with a hypnotising drumbeat and bassline. I really prefer its more somber tone to Hikari's bubbly-sweet sound; and the fact that I discovered it so young and have loved it since then makes perfect sense considering the music taste I went on to develop.</p>
                    <p>I haven't been into KH for a while and I lost some of the people that made that hyperfixation possible, but I consider it an interest that is simply lying dormant until the next big thing comes out. It completely took over my life for a good period and I had such a genuine love for its characters, the world, and of course the music that gave it all so much life!</p>

                    <summary><b>Bury the Light</b> - Casey Edwards</summary>
                    <p>I know I was very late to the DmC5 train, but upon hearing Bury the Light for the first time during some guy's stream on Twitch, back in 2021, I went from never having cared about the franchise to playing it and adopting it as a new obsession in the span of like 2 days. It's no wonder the song is considered a gateway drug into the series.</p>
                    <p>Many things about DmC5 and specifically Vergil appealed to me greatly, so I played through the game (even while not being super good at it) and sought out as much info about this iconic character as I could. In lieu of playing the older games I watched the cutscenes of the 3rd and 4th games; I also read the manga centering on V (or the chapters that were available so far), another character that was very neocore, and watched several youtube videos about the series and the characters.</p>
                    <p>Bury the Light is an amazing song not just as a dynamic soundtrack to the game, but also in its own merit as something of a prog metal track. The composer has a whole video on its production and it's a really interesting view into all the little layers and details that make it a fuckin' banger of a song, as well as how the lyrics relate to Vergil, universally considered one of the coolest characters in videogames!</p>

          <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
          <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
          <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
          <p><b>13/10/2024</b>: Another sneaky update in the early hours of Monday, but still counts. Should be done with part 2 of my newest blog article soon! Also have a brand new page in the works!</p>
          <p><b>06/10/2024</b>: It's not Monday until I've slept, so this update is still on time haha! The dreaded French exam has gone, I got excellent results on the comprehension part and all I have to do is pray I got a good enough score in the expression tests. Hopefully I'll have a bit more time to work on this site for now! I also put up a new blog post that has a sequel incoming at some point!</p>
          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
