                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>The Bitter End</b> - Placebo</summary>
                    <p>Yet another recent addition straight from a "2000's rock" playlist that made me think "how have I never heard this banger before?!", I've been a little obsessed with it since the first hearing. The name Placebo was not unfamiliar to me, as I had a vivid memory of one of their songs being played on loop by my sister when we were younger; sadly it wasn't this one, otherwise I think it might have changed my brain chemistry.</p>
                    <p>Or maybe it's good that I only stumbled upon it now, being equipped with a more eclectic taste refined over the years. The very prominent bass absolutely carries the instrumental, setting a suffocating pace that doesn't relent until a little after the halfway point in the song. The vocals alternating going up and down from a monotone baseline on each line are addictive, high in pitch but painting a dark scene, which in my view culminates in the line "as you're walking awaaaaay reminds me that it's killing time", at which point everything stops and you finally get a chance to release the breath you didn't know you were holding. At least, until the song picks back up in the outro, with renewed vigour in the drums and vocals.</p>
                    <p>Despite it being a new addition to my library, it's become a staple of my car rides to school. It's such a fun song to sing along and bop the head to, all while trying not to get too excited and start speeding!</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Leider</b> - Eisbrecher</summary>
                    <p>The last of the "Big Four" NDH bands (by my own designation) to be featured here, Eisbrecher is the one whose style I always felt the most resistance to, going so far as to claim I didn't like the group, only a handful of their songs. Founded by the original singer of Megaherz, they had a distinctly more electronic sound compared to the other bands in the pantheon.</p>
                    <p>Eisbrecher came to me in 2011 through a very special tumblr friend (who's getting a dedicated blog post at some point) with the song "Kinder der Nacht". I didn't really look for more of their music until a few months later when I came across this track, which became my new favourite out of the two that I knew. The pounding beat, punchy guitar riffs, atmospheric synths and deep vocals tapped into a music taste gene that would be fully reawakened soon after, with my rediscovery of Rammstein.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of which, I've been itching for German metal again and listening to a bit of Megaherz and Eisbrecher. I definitely think Alexx sounds much better in the latter — he'd grown a lot as a singer by the time he founded it — and more specifically in Antikörper. There's so many NDH singers that try to copy what made Rammstein's Till so iconic, but I think Alexx stands well on his own. I'm excited to revisit their music with a more open mind than I did a decade ago.</p>

          <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
          <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
          <p><b>13/10/2024</b>: Another sneaky update in the early hours of Monday, but still counts. Should be done with part 2 of my newest blog article soon! Also have a brand new page in the works!</p>
          <p><b>06/10/2024</b>: It's not Monday until I've slept, so this update is still on time haha! The dreaded French exam has gone, I got excellent results on the comprehension part and all I have to do is pray I got a good enough score in the expression tests. Hopefully I'll have a bit more time to work on this site for now! I also put up a new blog post that has a sequel incoming at some point!</p>
          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
