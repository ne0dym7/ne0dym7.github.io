                    <summary><b>Perfect</b> - Simple Plan</summary>
                    <p>Another classic from my childhood, this song evokes a sense of nostalgia like few others. There is something about the instruments and the vocals that is laced with the most 2000's sounding drug.</p>
                    <p> It has come and gone from my usual listens over the years, but every time I revisit it, I grow fonder of it. The iconic guitar intro, the guitar tone, the drumming pattern, the vocals and backing vocals (in the last chorus... so good), it all just comes together so perfectly (pun intended). The lyrics also hit home and hard; although they don't 100% match my life experiences, I also have struggled with a rough relationship with my father for a long time, so if I think too hard about them I get a little emo.</p>
                    <p>Did you know Simple Plan are Québécois? I never really listened to their music apart from this and a couple other tracks, but it's nice knowing a band from QC were part of my childhood all along.</p>

                    <summary><b>Controlling Crowds</b> - Archive</summary>
                    <p>I came to know this relatively obscure group through a guy I liked, and although "Fuck U" is a great song, when I checked out a bit more of their discography and stumbled upon Controlling Crowds, the title track simply blew me away.</p>
                    <p>A 10-minute trip-hop epic (a genre I was not at all familiar with), I like to think of this song as a game with several levels that each build on the previous: an intro with a meandering synth line and repeating low note, then a drumbeat, then a new synth track; after a pause, the main riff begins and soon the vocals enter, going from a hypnotic monotone spoken-word section to an ethereal  bridge and finally a soft singing voice accompanied only by an acoustic guitar wraps up the first half of the song. The next level begins much like the previous, but then a (real) bass kicks in with what is one of my favourite basslines ever, giving the track so much weight, momentum and energy. I could listen forever to the repeated line "killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more". The acoustic guitar returns to finish this section too, and the last part continues with a new drumtrack and the monotone vocals being drowned in background noise, until it all abruptly ends with a ringing sound, leading into the album's second track.</p>
                    <p>Honestly, there is too much to love about this song in my opinion. It is also an excellent music to vibe to while high!</p>

          <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
          <p><b>13/10/2024</b>: Another sneaky update in the early hours of Monday, but still counts. Should be done with part 2 of my newest blog article soon! Also have a brand new page in the works!</p>
          <p><b>06/10/2024</b>: It's not Monday until I've slept, so this update is still on time haha! The dreaded French exam has gone, I got excellent results on the comprehension part and all I have to do is pray I got a good enough score in the expression tests. Hopefully I'll have a bit more time to work on this site for now! I also put up a new blog post that has a sequel incoming at some point!</p>
          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
