                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Nara</b> - alt-J</summary>
                    <p>As mentioned before, Lollapalooza in 2015 was my first festival and I'd only gone to see Bastille with friends. I enjoyed the experience, but didn't really come out of there with any new favourite artists; except one: alt-J (or Δ, as I would insist). We didn't go to their stage directly, but rather saw it from afar for a little while. It was likely that moment that put their name in the back of my mind for me to check out later.</p>
                    <p>With their artsy lyrics (a bit like Bastille at that time) and instrumentals, and dreamy vocals with some French sprinkled in, the group rapidly joined my faves. Breezeblocks was among the first songs I tried to learn on the bass and I spent a long time manually writing down the layered lyrics during the outro; Matilda was one of the first songs of theirs I heard and I couldn't help remembering it when I watched Léon recently; the Intros to albums 1 and 2 are both incredily hypnotising and stand as great songs by themselves.</p>
                    <p>I picked Nara because it has only grown on me over time; it not only has beautiful lyrics but also a breathtaking instrumental arrangement, especially in the last section. So many different sounds and textures come together to create a stunning, ethereal mix that always makes me feel like I'm floating out of this world into the heavens.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Brennisteinn</b> - Sigur Rós</summary>
                    <p>It was at some point between 2010 and 2011 that Disney was running ads on TV for the documentary "Earth" featuring Hoppípolla by Sigur Rós. I've always been soft for uplifting, inspirational tunes, and that one in particular moved me so much I never forgot it. I remember one day listening to it so much on loop, losing track of time, that I missed my English class.</p>
                    <p>In 2015 the group re-entered my radar, probably because I had recently started learning the bass, and somehow learned about artists that play electric guitar with a violin/cello bow (like Jónsi) to get special sounds (I bought one myself to try it out). What got me into them was their then-most recent album Kveikur, which has a kind of heavy, industrial sound; compared to my preexisting knowledge of their music, it was mindblowing.</p>
                    <p>I listened to a lot of their live performances and checked out some of their other albums, and I quickly became addicted to their music. During my flight to London in late July I almost exclusively had Sigur Rós on repeat, and once I was in the city I was able to visit a HMV and buy CD's of some of my favourite bands, including Kveikur.</p>

          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
          <p><b>22/08/2024</b>: Biiig update! I've moved the entire website from Neocities to Github, and acquired a shiny custom domain! While I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the old internet revival community, I decided that I really wanted the custom domain, and it just wasn't going to be viable on Neocities. With that said, everything else is staying the exact same way! I've also done some minor changes to text in various places, and added a recent drawing to Harrow's page.</p>
          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
