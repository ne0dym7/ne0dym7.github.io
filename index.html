                    <summary><b>Hearing Damage</b> - Thom Yorke</summary>
                    <p>As this website hits 3 months since its inception, I thought I'd finally feature the song that served as my constant soundtrack throughout the whole time I spent setting it up! I say "finally" because I was refraining from featuring music that I'd just discovered, preferring significant tracks with a longer history, but this song's impact is far from lessened by its recency.</p>
                    <p>I started this website the week before a week-long holiday/school break meaning I spent a fortnight in a weed-fuelled trance, working on my new hobby for hours every day. Having watched the first Twilight movie some time before and rejoiced in its cringe nostalgia, a few days into my frenzy I put on New Moon to watch on the side as I worked, and a certain scene really caught my attention: the scene where the werewolves are chasing Victoria. It's a mesmerising piece of cinema in an otherwise questionable movie, and this song is a major reason why.</p>
                    <p>While chase scenes usually have exciting soundtracks to raise the adrenaline, this one has a droning bass, a dizzying drumbeat and a monotone vocal line (all of which have a uniquely appealing sound to me); you can even excuse the wacky acrobatics thanks to the fascinating cinematography and of course the music.</p>
                    <p>During my two or so weeks setting up this website, this song quickly cemented itself as my ultimate stoner song.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>The Outsider</b> - A Perfect Circle</summary>
                    <p>Considering I first heard this song (this version) at maybe 11 years old and that it's always stuck around in my library, it's a mystery how I never got into Tool or the superband A Perfect Circle (although I do know a few other of their songs).</p>
                    <p>The year was 2010, there was going to be a new Resident Evil movie and this song was in the trailer. I saw it for some reason despite not being interested in the series, and my young edgy mind that was already developing a liking for alternative rock/metal very quickly latched onto the soundtrack and claimed it as one of my favourite songs. I prefer this "Apocalypse Mix" much more than the original!</p>
                    <p>In contrast, around the same time I discovered another remix of an APC song: Counting Bodies Like Sheep (...). It is a pretty edgy song as well, but I prefer the original version of that one, Pet.</p>

            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
            <p><b>26/11/2024</b>: Weekly update is here! Since the last changelog I did some changes on Neo's page and also on the front page, putting the new commi at the top and moving the previous image to the bottom.</p>
            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
