                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Zombie</b> - The Cranberries</summary>
                    <p>Even as a big admirer of all things Ireland, I somehow never heard this huge hit until a few years ago, when I was hanging out in a major city in FFXIV and heard a bard play a tune that really caught my ear; I sent them a PM asking what was the song they just played, and it was this one.</p>
                    <p>Although the circumstances of this discovery were light-hearted, the weight of the song was never lost on me. It laments the deaths of innocent people, especially children, as a result of attacks perpetrated by the paramilitaries during the Troubles; and the sadness and outrage at such tragedies are perfectly distilled into the poignant lyrics, the distorted instruments, and the stunning vocals by O'Riordan. From what I read on Wikipedia, I'm not sure I've ever encountered a song that was written "from the heart" as much as Zombie.</p>
                    <p>One of the most striking details about the song that always tugs at my heartstrings is the riff played before the verses, which resolves down to an unexpected, devastating B (shout out to 12tone on Youtube's brilliant analysis). That plus the pre-choruses never fail to make me cry.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Dehors novembre</b> - Les Colocs</summary>
                    <p>Along with Les Cowboys Fringants, Les Colocs were among the first artists from Québec I heard, on a playlist of Québécois music that my partner's friend created for me for my birthday. Even though it wasn't of a genre I listened to, Tassez-vous de d'là stood out to me and made me curious to listen to the rest of the album.</p>
                    <p>Over time the more I listened to the album's last and title track, the more it grew on me. As I've said in the past, I've been really enjoying music with some sort of monotonous vocal line or droning instruments that build up, and this song has all of that. Unlike their most popular track, which has depressing lyrics set to a relatively upbeat tone, this one is just depressing all around. The repeating guitar riff and bassline, the elegant clarinet and harmonica, and the mesmerising percussion provide a dark ambiance perfect for the lyrics' heavy subject.</p>
                    <p>It's honestly hard not to get chills, knowing the singer Dédé's fate. I knew when I discovered the group that he had taken his own life, but it wasn't until some time later that I learned how he did it, and that made this song go up several levels in the tragic scale.</p>

          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
          <p><b>22/08/2024</b>: Biiig update! I've moved the entire website from Neocities to Github, and acquired a shiny custom domain! While I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the old internet revival community, I decided that I really wanted the custom domain, and it just wasn't going to be viable on Neocities. With that said, everything else is staying the exact same way! I've also done some minor changes to text in various places, and added a recent drawing to Harrow's page.</p>
          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
