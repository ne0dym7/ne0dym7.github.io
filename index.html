                    <summary><b>Death Stranding</b> - CHVRCHES</summary>
                    <p>Chvrches entered my radar in 2015 when I heard "Recover" playing at a restaurant I used to frequent close to my high school; the song's memorable arpeggiated lead melody and crystalline vocals in an emotional crescendo that peaks in its soaring chorus intrigued me enough to seek out a few more tracks from their first album.</p>
                    <p>So in 2019 Death Stranding came out, a brilliant game I've yet to pick back up and finish. I was aware of BMTH's song that was made for the game, but I had no idea Chvrches had one too until the Game Awards in December, when they performed an orchestral arrangement of their song. It was exactly the kind of music that always gives me a good cry, the auditory equivalent of a lump in the throat. The lyrics are infused with a fierce desire to hold onto hope and human connections amidst chaos and despair, and the orchestra instrumentation along with the singer's ethereal and increasingly emotional vocals made a huge impression on me.</p>
                    <p>The studio version is amazing in its own way. Lacking the sublime sound of strings and brasses, it has a rather more melancholy vibe that nonetheless stirs indescribable emotions. Naturally it ended up being the version I'm most familiar with, and I hope I can hear it in the game some day.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Lacrimosa</b> - Kalafina</summary>
                    <p>I came across this Japanese group that blends J-pop, rock and classical music two separate times, through the ending themes of different animes: the first was "Magia" in Madoka Magica, and the second was "Lacrimosa" in Kuroshitsuji (neither of which series I finished watching).</p>
                    <p>While the former has a captivatingly dark sound, I picked Lacrimosa as a feature because it led me to look for more of their music, and also because it completely dominated my bassist brain for a period of time. As mentioned before, I would often bring my favourite songs to my bass lessons to dissect, and this track totally blew my teacher's mind, allowing us to spend a couple of lessons analysing it and attempting to transcribe it. It has a gorgeous bassline that carries the entire song, dynamic and colourful, like brushtrokes on a painting.</p>
                    <p>Revisiting the few songs by Kalafina I have saved, I think Magia might be my favourite to listen to after all, but I had to feature this one just for the impact it had on my bass learning career.</p>

            <p><b>26/11/2024</b>: Weekly update is here! Since the last changelog I did some changes on Neo's page and also on the front page, putting the new commi at the top and moving the previous image to the bottom.</p>
            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
