                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Everybody Wants to Rule the World</b> - Tears For Fears</summary>
                    <p>For how big of a classic this song is, it's shocking how it had completely evaded me until middle of or late 2018, when I came across a very specific Final Fantasy XV fanart on twitter. It depicted a chibi Ardyn sitting on a throne, with song lyrics above and below the artwork: "Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure / Nothing ever lasts forever" (and the song title in the caption). I spent a long time looking for it, and when I did eventually track down the original post, it was already decided that Ardyn would be my favourite character, and that this song would have a permanent spot in my library.</p>
                    <p>It's not hard to see the artist's vision in choosing this track. The lyrics, despite being set to an upbeat instrumental, are poignant, touching on themes such as nuclear war, power abuse and environmental devastation — and it's impossible not to sing and chant along.</p>
                    <p>But this song wouldn't be the same without the insane instrumentals in such a mesmerising time signature: the at first disorienting, shuffling drumbeat, the bassline that chugs along ever forward, the bright synthesised chords, and the guitar riffs and solos that give the track some extra flavour, making it unforgettable and timeless.</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>When You're Evil</b> - Voltaire</summary>
                    <p>I've been drawn to villains for as long as I've enjoyed fiction and created my own stories. There's a special place in my heart for a character who is (willingly or not) corrupted and becomes a loyal subordinate to a bigger baddie, who will follow their every command and rejoice in the havoc they wreak; my main OC as a child had been a hero up until a moment he was tempted by the dark side.</p>
                    <p>The timeline is a bit unclear so I can't confirm whether my discovery of this song preceded my first contact with the tumblr user "thedarkdoctor" (whom I've mentioned a few times before, although not by name), but regardless if I found the song before or after meeting that person, it fit perfectly with my budding roleplaying character. My "RP-self" was little more than a self-insert who found themself in the twisted Doctor's TARDIS and became his companion, eager to prove their worth and learn his evil ways.</p>
                    <p>That is all of course buried in the past, but this song has aged super well to me, despite "dark cabaret" not being a genre I listen to. Everything about it is so compelling, starting with the violin that creates a vivid gothic atmosphere, punctuated by a steady drumbeat as proud as the narrator. The lyrics and vocals, boasting about all sorts of delightful villainy, are also incredibly memorable and evocative and such great fun to sing along with.</p>

            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
            <p><b>26/11/2024</b>: Weekly update is here! Since the last changelog I did some changes on Neo's page and also on the front page, putting the new commi at the top and moving the previous image to the bottom.</p>
            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
