                    <summary><b>Wilder Wein</b> - Rammstein</summary>
                    <p>Everyone who has known me for any length of time will know that Rammstein is my absolute favourite band. Before the special Rammstein article I'm writing goes up, I wanted to share at least one of their songs. I had a good think about which song that would be, and ultimately decided on Wilder Wein. I never counted it amongst my favourites, but now the more I listen to it, the more fascinating it becomes.</p>
                    <p>This song always had an air of mystery to it; it was never released on a studio album, being a demo that was famously performed on their legendary 1998 Live aus Berlin concert — according to a fansite, its last live performance. Even among their softer songs this version has a unique sound and texture, thanks to the acoustic guitars that fill the latter half, lifting the solemn tone established in the beginning, and the synthesised violin carefully sprinkled about that tugs at the heartstrings.</p>
                    <p>The lyrics are a tad more poetic than their usual stuff, but apparently they're about sex. Typical for Rammstein, haha!</p>

                    <summary><b>The Blossoming Beelzebub</b> - Dir en grey</summary>
                    <p>It's not rare in my musical tastes that a band goes into hibernation for a while only to resurface with renewed strength later, and the Japanese giants are this times, like, five. I've listened to their music on and off for over a decade, but late 2016 was when I got really into them, diving into full albums when previously I'd only heard some loose tracks.</p>
                    <p>I was a freshman in Engineering and had got into the habit of chilling/napping on a sofa at the student lounge before my afternoon class. According to my twitter, it was on one of those days that I randomly put on the full Dum Spiro Spero album, which led me to discover a lot of great tracks from that and other albums. This song is the first in the album (after the intro) and it immediately got me hooked, making DEG my main soundtrack for several months.</p>
                    <p>I respect all their work, but I'm a bigger fan of the heavier releases. Fun fact: the bassist, Toshiya, is one of my biggest musician inspirations; I've even cosplayed as him!</p>

          <p><b>29/09/2024</b>: I have been incredibly busy this week, so I don't really have the energy to write music features this time, but aside from that, front page update!</p>
          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
