                    <summary><b>Heavydirtysoul</b> - Twenty One Pilots</summary>
                    <p>Admitting that I was once a fan of TOP feels weird considering they're so big now. At the risk of sounding like a hipster, I discovered them in 2015, through a friend in high school who asked one day if anyone wanted to go with him to a show by this band. I hadn't heard of them so I listened through their "first" album Vessel (their first 2 were self-released and not as well-known) and found I quite enjoyed it. (In the end I didn't go to the show.)</p>
                    <p>I found TOP around the time they were promoting their upcoming album, Blurryface. When the album released I promptly bought it on digital, and I was so enamoured with them and the album that I actually also ordered on eBay a signed deluxe copy! The packaging is very nice.</p>
                    <p>I believe they were still pretty indie at that time, but they really blew up with the track Stressed Out, which I went on to dislike lol. I didn't keep up with them after Blurryface, but I can say I liked them before they were cool!</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Boulevard of Broken Dreams</b> - Green Day</summary>
                    <p>Believe it or not, the channel MTV was still a thing when I was younger and I remember it showed music videos with some frequency, because every so often they would do an "artist marathon" and only play music videos from a specific artist for a number of hours. That's how I got to know Eminem and Green Day, although only a few songs from both of those stuck with me.</p>
                    <p>One of them is Boulevard, one of this band's most iconic songs and deservedly so. From catchy lyrics to an instrumental progression with surprisingly (for the genre?) deep twists that enhance the song's meaning, all carried by a memorable, instantly recognisable tremolo effect on the guitar. Wikipedia has a whole paragraph on the song's chord progressions, and there's also the interesting analysis by 12Tone on Youtube, speaking to the track's brilliant composition, especially the outro.</p>
                    <p>Considering other 2000's songs I've featured here that kind of have a similar sound, I'm beginning to think I quite like this type of emo music.</p>

            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
            <p><b>26/11/2024</b>: Weekly update is here! Since the last changelog I did some changes on Neo's page and also on the front page, putting the new commi at the top and moving the previous image to the bottom.</p>
            <p><b>20/11/2024</b>: I swear I was going to update the front page last night, but my room was invaded by a giant moth that scared me so much I went to sleep on the sofa!! We managed to set it free this morning though, so here is a belated update. It ended up being a little Halloween-y, even though the best day of the year was 3 weeks ago. Well, it's never too late for Halloween. I also made some changes in the Neo page, and got a new commi from siins which will get a spotlight soon!</p>
            <p><b>12/11/2024</b>: With my long overdue blog post finally up, things might be getting back on track so here's the weekly update!</p>
            <p><b>06/11/2024</b>: Time got absolutely away from me and I've also been feeling a bit under the weather, so I couldn't update in time last week.</p>
            <p><b>27/10/2024</b>: Finally got to do a proper Sunday update! My newest blog post is coming soon, I promise, it's been hard to put a lot of time into it. Sadly, the Québec school I wanted to apply for just happened to close their applications for now, so let's hope they reopen soon!!</p>
            <p><b>21/10/2024</b>: Gasp, this update was actually on Monday. I just feel too tired on Sunday evening to write the little music comments, as they require the most brainpower, so I really ought to set a new update day or just change the frequency of music features. In any case, good news, I got B2 level in the French expression tests!</p>
