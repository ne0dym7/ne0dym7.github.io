                    <summary><b>5. März</b> - Megaherz</summary>
                    <p>While I am known for being a massive Rammstein fan to this day, I believe this song by Megaherz was the first song in German that I liked! I began writing a blog post about how I came to know Rammstein, but since that's still nowhere close to being done, I'll say it now that it was indirectly through fanvideos of characters from Hetalia: while looking up a couple of artists featured in some videos, I eventually arrived at my all-time favourite band.</p>
                    <p>Megaherz was one of those bands whose music served as background to a slideshow video of (uncredited) fanart of Prussia, a fan-favourite character from that problematic series. At a time when I was starting to get into heavier music, it was love at first listen: the first 15 seconds, with drowned-out intruments, prepare the stage for a super high-energy intro that instantly lets you know you're about to hear a banger. After a subdued verse and bridge where the vocals take the forefront, both singer and instruments come together in the chorus with full strength, completing what is one of my favourite ever sets of lyrics + arrangement.</p>
                    <p>In fact, I've always been such a fan of the lyrics in this song that I would often be singing them under my breath, and I seriously cannot understate how much this song (and others) helped me in my German learning journey!</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Change (In the House of Flies)</b> - Deftones</summary>
                    <p>I've said that I normally don't put music I've very recently discovered in here, but for the past week I've been pretty into Deftones, after hearing this song for the first time in one of my "2000's rock" playlists. The band's name was not unknown to me, but I somehow have gone my entire life without hearing a single song by them, not even their most popular one!</p>
                    <p>I was playing some Fallout 76 with Jim & Athena when it came up. Being a bit high, I was absolutely enthralled by everything about this song: the intro with that incredibly atmospheric sample; the singer's breathy and dreamlike vocals accompanied by the bass; the explosive chorus; the chilling third verse; the bridge and the outro and just every part of it all. Nothing is wasted in this song, it is simply perfect and I couldn't believe I'd never heard it before. For the rest of the evening I could only listen to this track over and over, absorbing every detail, every sound.</p>
                    <p>It made me want to seek out more of this band and discover their flavour of metal music. I haven't finished listening through all their albums yet, but I'm enjoying what I've heard so far, especially White Pony. It's always exciting to find a new artist to like and I haven't felt this curious about a band in a long time.</p>

          <p><b>22/08/2024</b>: Biiig update! I've moved the entire website from Neocities to Github, and acquired a shiny custom domain! While I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the old internet revival community, I decided that I really wanted the custom domain, and it just wasn't going to be viable on Neocities. With that said, everything else is staying the exact same way! I've also done some minor changes to text in various places, and added a recent drawing to Harrow's page.</p>
          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
