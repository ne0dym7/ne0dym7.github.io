                    <summary><b>Heavydirtysoul</b> - Twenty One Pilots</summary>
                    <p>Admitting that I was once a fan of TOP feels weird considering they're so big now. At the risk of sounding like a hipster, I discovered them in 2015, through a friend in high school who asked one day if anyone wanted to go with him to a show by this band. I hadn't heard of them so I listened through their "first" album Vessel (their first 2 were self-released and not as well-known) and found I quite enjoyed it. (In the end I didn't go to the show.)</p>
                    <p>I found TOP around the time they were promoting their upcoming album, Blurryface. When the album released I promptly bought it on digital, and I was so enamoured with them and the album that I actually also ordered on eBay a signed deluxe copy! The packaging is very nice.</p>
                    <p>I believe they were still pretty indie at that time, but they really blew up with the track Stressed Out, which I went on to dislike lol. I didn't keep up with them after Blurryface, but I can say I liked them before they were cool!</p>

                  <details class="musiccaption">
                    <summary><b>Boulevard of Broken Dreams</b> - Green Day</summary>
                    <p>Believe it or not, the channel MTV was still a thing when I was younger and I remember it showed music videos with some frequency, because every so often they would do an "artist marathon" and only play music videos from a specific artist for a number of hours. That's how I got to know Eminem and Green Day, although only a few songs from both of those stuck with me.</p>
                    <p>One of them is Boulevard, one of this band's most iconic songs and deservedly so. From catchy lyrics to an instrumental progression with surprisingly (for the genre?) deep twists that enhance the song's meaning, all carried by a memorable, instantly recognisable tremolo effect on the guitar. Wikipedia has a whole paragraph on the song's chord progressions, and there's also the interesting analysis by 12Tone on Youtube, speaking to the track's brilliant composition, especially the outro.</p>
                    <p>Considering other 2000's songs I've featured here that kind of have a similar sound, I'm beginning to think I quite like this type of emo music.</p>

            <p><b>15/01/2025</b>: It's a day late but here's update! We had a lovely time in Québec and took lots of nice photos. I didn't feel like writing new music comments this week, as my mind is taken over by something very important: we're getting a cat tonight!!</p>
            <p><b>07/01/2025</b>: My birthday is tomorrow, so this is a special update! As a birthday indulgence, I have decided to finally break the rule of no repeating music artist in order to feature some of my favourite groups again. My prayers for snow in time for my bday were answered, and we are spending the weekend in Québec City, so I'm quite looking forward to that!</p>
            <p><b>31/12/2024</b>: Front page update! It's the last day of the year, and I'm super glad I've been able to keep working on the website for more than 40 weeks now! Some weeks were busier than others, but I never thought of giving up. 2025 will be an interesting year with all the preparations for the next step in my life, so let's hope everything works out.</p>
            <p><b>24/12/2024</b>: Happy holidays from Québec! Been having a great time in the cold and we just had some snowfall. Christmas season is always busy but I had the strength to put out a new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>16/12/2024</b>: Front page update! My Canada trip is tomorrow, yipeee which means I won't bother trying to come up with new music feature.</p>
            <p><b>10/12/2024</b>: I've been so busy with a new blog post, the last of my schoolwork and trip prepping that I didn't have time to think about any new music at all, so recycled feature it is. I am going to my hometown tomorrow and will be back on Sunday, and I leave for Canada next Tuesday!</p>
            <p><b>03/12/2024</b>: New front page update! I started yet another blog post to join the other drafts I will hopefully complete some day. University is almost over, which means I'm going to Canada soon!</p>
