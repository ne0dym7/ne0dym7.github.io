                    <summary><b>With Me</b> - Sum 41</summary>
                    <p>Me and my sister don't have much in common in music tastes, but there are a few songs I discovered through her that lodged themselves in my brain and never left. I believe this song was featured in a show she used to be obsessed with, and that is how she found it and by extension how I came to know it.</p>
                    <p>In my current emo appreciation era, I can see why it has continuously appealed to me so much. It has that highly nostalgic 2000's sound that I've already pointed out in previous song features, it's in 6/8 time which automatically qualifies it to be neocore, and the vocal line in the chorus always makes me sing along (especially the high B note in "I'll hold ON to this MOment"). Everything about this song just takes me back, and it has remained relevant in my library for many years.</p>
                    <p>A few years ago, an ex-friend and I picked it as a song for our OCship. That relationship ended and the ship fizzled out of existence, but my love for this song by itself is so strong that it carries no negative connotations for me. I win!</p>

                    <summary><b>Throat Full of Glass</b> - Combichrist</summary>
                    <p>I got into Devil May Cry in 2021, but my contact with the franchise actually dates back to late 2013, through a gameplay video from a channel I used to follow, of the much beloathed "DmC" reboot. They showcased just the intro, but it was enough to make me interested in the soundtrack featuring Combichrist.</p>
                    <p>I had heard of this group before due to their being sort of adjacent to Rammstein in the industrial metal genre. I checked out some of their tracks featured in the game, especially the licensed tracks in disc 2 of the OST, and I enjoyed quite a few of them. However, it was only this song that stood the test of time, always having a spot in my music library.</p>
                    <p>And it's for good reason: it has an insanely catchy chorus, really groovy and punchy instrumentals, and lyrics that relate to many of my favourite characters. I never got to fulfil my younger self's dream of playing the bad DmC game, but it left me a great musical legacy.</p>

          <p><b>22/09/2024</b>: Front page update! Surprisingly, I'll have another week off now (well there will be school activities but I don't plan on going), and I started yet another blog post, which is already halfway done so maybe there will finally be a new post? After 4 months?!</p>
          <p><b>15/09/2024</b>: I didn't update yesterday cuz I didn't have time to write music comments, but here it is!</p>
          <p><b>07/09/2024</b>: Front page update! I didn't end up making a lot of progress on the blog as promised, but I did spend this entire week researching for my Québec immigration plan, which is getting closer every day that passes. I don't have a concrete plan yet, but I've had a few ideas.</p>
          <p><b>31/08/2024</b>: A new update! I also have this whole next week off, so I'm hoping to be able to make some progress in a few old and new blog posts I've been cooking up. I also fixed a video in a Harrow blog post that broke when I ported the website.</p>
          <p><b>24/08/2024</b>: Here's the first weekly update in the new host!</p>
          <p><b>22/08/2024</b>: Biiig update! I've moved the entire website from Neocities to Github, and acquired a shiny custom domain! While I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the old internet revival community, I decided that I really wanted the custom domain, and it just wasn't going to be viable on Neocities. With that said, everything else is staying the exact same way! I've also done some minor changes to text in various places, and added a recent drawing to Harrow's page.</p>
          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
