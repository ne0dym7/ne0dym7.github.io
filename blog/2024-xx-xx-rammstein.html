          <p>when i created this website, one of my goals was to offer a glimpse of my musical taste by sharing songs that were representative of the sort of stuff i like to listen to. i've already shared more than 40 songs over the past 6 months, and there's still plenty of artists i have yet to feature. my initial concept (which i clearly did not abide by consistently) was that each week there would be one "wildcard" track — whatever the genre, it would probably appeal to most people — and one "heavy" track. i made this distinction because i still consider metal, in many different flavours, to be my favourite genre, even though my tastes have diversified compared to when i was younger and i don't always listen exclusively to metal any more.</p>
          <p>yet regardless of how much my musical taste may change, one group has held onto the title of my all-time favourite band for 12 years... i'm talking, of course, about <b>Rammstein</b>!! as promised a long time ago, i wanna talk in great detail about my history with my favourite group.</p>

          <h4>prelude: 2010</h4>
          <p>our story begins with a certain channel on youtube that made music videos with (uncredited) AP Hetalia fanart set to music from the characters' respective countries, with lyrics and translations in the captions. while stealing art is undeniably bad, this channel was responsible for introducing me to the notion of music in other languages, and in particular a couple of german-language groups stood out to me: Megaherz and E Nomine. the latter is an interesting project of dark trance/new-age music with gregorian chanting and german lyrics read out by famous voice actors; i went on to discover a few more songs by them, and it was probably in the process of browsing youtube that i stumbled the masters of Neue Deutsche Härte.</p>
          <p>(as a sidenote and proof of my uncanny ability to remember the most insignificant details, i know that this was in late 2010 because that is when i created an account in the defunct website Tetris Friends, and at one point i set as my status something to the effect of "rammstein are awesome!!".)</p>
          <p>the first two Rammstein songs i heard were <i>Sonne</i> and <i>Du hast</i>. i liked them well enough, but to be honest they weren't at the top of my musical taste pyramid, and eventually i removed them from my library during a purge of music i hadn't been listening to. astute readers may deduce that this action only served to load chekhov's gun, which remained stashed away somewhere in the back of my mind.</p>

          <h4>beginnings: 2012</h4>
          <p>it happens a lot that something will reappear in my life after a period of dormancy; sometimes that is a few months, other times it can be a number of years. 2012 was a pivotal year in my life, a new beginning for me and my family, as we had just moved to São Paulo from my tiny hometown. it was a time when we all still used facebook and played little games on that network; by june, the hot new game was called songpop, a quiz where you competed to correctly guess the title and artist given a short snipped of a song. chekhov's gun, or rather flamethrower, was fired: i recognised <i>Du hast</i> when it came up at some point, but it was a different Rammstein track, <i>Mutter</i>, that made me stop and think, "wait a minute. this is something else. i have to learn more about this band."</p>
          <p>i spent the next days, weeks and months listening through every Rammstein album, watching every music video and making-of, getting to know each band member, reading every song lyric and translation on the major fansites; that is, just living and breathing my new favourite band. i went several times to a mall downtown whose shops were all dedicated to rock music, selling CD's and records of almost any band you could think of, as well as T-shirts, pins, patches and other merch, and i over the course of a few weeks i bought all of their studio albums and live shows. i even made myself a poster to put on my wall!</p>
