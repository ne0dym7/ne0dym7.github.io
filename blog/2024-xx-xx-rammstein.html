          <p>when i created this website, one of my goals was to offer a glimpse of my musical taste by sharing songs that were representative of the sort of stuff i like to listen to. i've already shared more than 40 songs over the past 6 months, and there's still plenty of artists i have yet to feature. my initial concept (which i clearly did not abide by consistently) was that each week there would be one "wildcard" track — whatever the genre, it would probably appeal to most people — and one "heavy" track. i made this distinction because i still consider metal, in many different flavours, to be my favourite genre, even though my tastes have diversified compared to when i was younger and i don't always listen exclusively to metal any more.</p>
          <p>yet regardless of how much my musical taste may change, one group has held onto the title of my all-time favourite band for 12 years... i'm talking, of course, about <b>Rammstein</b>!! as promised a long time ago, i wanna talk in great detail about my history with my favourite group.</p>

          <h4>prelude: 2010</h4>
          <p>our story begins with a certain channel on youtube that made slideshows with (uncredited) AP Hetalia fanart set to music from the characters' respective countries, with lyrics and translations in the captions. while stealing art is undeniably bad and i cringe at the sight of those videos that are still up, this channel was responsible for introducing me to the notion of music in other languages, and in particular a couple of german-language groups stood out to me: Megaherz and E Nomine. the latter is an interesting project of dark trance/new-age music with gregorian chanting and german lyrics read out by famous voice actors; i went on to discover a few more songs by them, and it was probably in the process of browsing youtube and looking for more interesting german music that i stumbled the masters of Neue Deutsche Härte.</p>
          <p>(as a sidenote and proof of my uncanny ability to remember the most insignificant details, i know that this was in late 2010 because that is when i created an account in the defunct website Tetris Friends, and at one point i set as my status something to the effect of "rammstein are awesome!!".)</p>
          <p>the first two Rammstein songs i heard were <i>Sonne</i> and <i>Du hast</i>. i liked them well enough, but to be honest they weren't at the top of my musical taste pyramid, and eventually i even went as far as removing them from my library during a purge of music i hadn't been listening to. astute readers may deduce that this action only served to load chekhov's gun, which remained stashed away somewhere in the back of my mind.</p>

          <h4>beginnings: 2012</h4>
          <p>it happens a lot that something will reappear in my life after a period of dormancy; sometimes that is a few months, other times it can be a number of years. 2012 was a pivotal year in my life, a new beginning for me and my family, as we had just moved to São Paulo from my tiny hometown. it was a time when we all still used facebook and played little games on that platform; by june, the hot new game was called Songpop, a quiz where you compete with another player to correctly guess a song's title or artist given a short snipped. chekhov's gun, or rather flamethrower, was fired: i recognised <i>Du hast</i> when it came up at some point, but it was a different Rammstein track, <i>Mutter</i>, that made me stop and think, "wait a minute. this is something else. i have to learn more about this band."</p>
          <p>within days i was committed to live and breathe my new favourite band. though it may have taken a few weeks for me to check out their whole discography, i eventually learned the names and faces of all the members, watched every music video and their making-ofs, and read every song lyric and translation on the major fansites. i became interested in learning german and tried out several websites/softwares and self-teaching books, in addition to using the band's music itself as a teaching tool; a lot of Rammstein's songs are like little stories told from various PoV's, thus offering a great variety of grammatical structures, vocabulary, idioms and wordplays that i was only too happy to dissect.</p>

          <p>i was not content with just my illegally downloaded MP3s, though. even at that time, i understood the importance of "supporting one's favourite artists", and physical media was still a thing in 2012, so i decided to buy the CDs. in downtown São Paulo there is a mall called "Galeria do Rock", containing tons of shops completely dedicated to rock, metal and alternative subcultures in general, wherein one might find anything from CD's and DVD's and vinyl records, to t-shirts and patches and pins. that part of town is notoriously a little dangerous (and even more so nowadays), but i, a 13 year old determined to get my hands on anything Rammstein, visited the mall on a number of occasions (sometimes right before class) to acquire all of their studio albums, live shows — even if some of them might have been national editions rather than imported.</p>

          <p>obviously i did not keep quiet about my newfound obsession. over on twitter, my "IRL" social, i'd post random snippets of lyrics, </p>
