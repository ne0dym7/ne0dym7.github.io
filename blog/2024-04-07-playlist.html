          <p>i present to you my "pet playlist". it dates back to december of 2014, a statement that makes me feel old, and is still being maintained by me! every once in a while i add or maybe remove a couple of songs. right now it contains around 80 tracks, some of which i added shortly after discovering, while others are songs that i've known for a while and that were repurposed for the playlist. they may or may not be part of my core musical preferences; what matters is that they follow a loosely-defined theme, one that is summarised by the playlist's title: <i><b>you've got the power and control</b></i>.</p>
          <p>as revealed in a previous blog post, edgy tastes have occupied a space in my brain for the better part of my life, including but not limited to: <b>power dynamics, corruption, domination and submission, delusions of grandeur, punishment, masochism, obsession and insanity</b>. this playlist thus encapsulates all of those concepts.</p>
          <p>since it contains songs from all phases of my life and very different genres, i organised it in such a way that the first 3/4 or so are more pop-sounding, easier listens (although with some exceptions to spice things up!), while the latter 1/4 are heavier and less likely to appeal to the average listener. i think i did a decent job crafting an interesting and logical progression!</p>
          <p>the playlist's title is taken from the first track, "Blame" by Bastille. this is a really influential track for me: 2014 was the year i discovered that band, by influence of a close friend from school, and it very quickly became one of my favourites. it softened and expanded my music tastes, introducing me to indie-rock/pop after a strong industrial metal and metalcore phase. at that time Blame was still unreleased and only existed in recordings of live or radio performances, teasing us with a decidedly heavier tone than their first studio album and much darker lyrics that appealed specifically to me and my friend. well, eventually Blame was released officially, along with a music video that was... really nothing like we all imagined haha, and in truth i haven't kept up with the band or enjoyed their latest releases much, but the significance of the track remains.</p>
