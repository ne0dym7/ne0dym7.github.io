          <p>tumblr has been having a bit of a renaissance and even i find myself looking at it again regularly and checking on my friends' posts, despite not actually use it for posting anything. frankly, it's a little bit bizarre to think that i'm still logging into the same ol' account that i've had for more than a decade, and if i look at my archive, 99% of everything i ever posted or reblogged is still there. i was a literal child when i created my blog back in 2011, and now that i'm an adult, it's so fun to sift through my archived posts and find little gold nuggets of fond memories amidst a ton of cringy stuff i can no longer relate to.</p>
          <p>today i'd like to talk about one of my most important phases on tumblr, which despite being cringy to look at and think about in retrospect, was responsible for shaping part of my personality for a good while and still brings me good memories. it is the tale of my edgyfication, my short career in <b>role-playing</b>, and my friendship with the user known as <b>thedarkdoctor</b>.</p>

          <p style="font-size: small;">(spoilers: <b>thedarkdoctor</b> and other blogs by the same author were deleted from tumblr a long time ago, as the creator no longer wished to be associated with those profiles. i had the opportunity to catch up with him in 2018, we reminisced on our old friendship and exchanged news, but have not kept contact since. out of respect, however, i will refer to him as N in place of his common nickname.)</p>

          <h4>chapter 1: neo's tumblr origin story</h4>
          <p>so, i am a certified tumblr veteran and should be entitled to compensation. that is because i created my account, which i still use, in 12 of april, 2011 — although it wasn't my first attempt at getting into tumblr, as i had made an account earlier than that. i am not even going to try and defend the fact that i, a 12 year old, got on tumblr; in fact, i had been on twitter since like 2009, and writing club penguin blogs with other people before that. anyway, i spent my first two weeks or so only reblogging generic aesthetic posts and quotes in portuguese, but once i discovered the fandom side, i totally shifted gears and even deleted those first few posts in order to start over. i was on tumblr so early in its life that we didn't even have photosets yet!</p>
          <p>as a fun bit of context, getting on tumblr directly followed my Club Penguin era. i was on club penguin during its prime, from 2008 until the time i started using tumblr, which served as a reset point for my online persona. i will probably make a post dedicated to that game at some point!</p>
          <p>my first fandoms were harry potter and starkid musicals, but it didn't take long for me to discover the massive british phenomenon that was Doctor Who. at that time, doctor who was largely unknown in brazil and thus suddenly finding myself a part of this community and making so many dashboard friends (in that classic "reblog if you like X!" way) definitely felt awesome. in july 31, i decided to change my username to something that reflected both of my main interests and a follower suggested "the wand of rassilon". i immediately obliged and adopted the handle, because it was the first suggestion and it probably sounded quite unique in my head, although i was certainly too young and naive to think it could have any weird undertones, lol.</p>

          <h4>chapter 2: the fateful meeting and neo's RPfication</h4>
          <p>i can't tell how i first came across the user <b>thedarkdoctor</b>. i don't have the benefit of looking through their archive like i do mine, because the blog has long since been deleted (and the username, i just learned, was taken by a porn bot). all i can say is that through their influence, on august 24, i discovered the Slender Man, particularly in the MarbleHornets universe, and other creepypastas. i was thoroughly freaked out, having never been exposed to scary content like that before. but my new tumblr acquaintance fascinated me. i looked through their blog, filled with edited pictures of the Tenth Doctor, gifs from gory and horror media, music with edgy lyrics, as well as their role-playing posts themselves. the very next day i posted, "I might like Dark!Doctor too much."</p>
          <p>i always enjoyed writing my own little stories, but unlike my older sister who plenty of experience in forum role-playing in various fandoms and original settings, i never got into RPing. i remember one day being at my grandmother's house and writing a Dark Doctor fanfic on my iPod (in my imperfect english), which i did post on tumblr but was unable to find again for this article. it was something of a prototype for my own RP character that came about later on, and also writing practice for me. since i couldn't find it in my blog, it's likely that i felt so embarrassed by it (both content-wise and writing-wise) that i deleted it. although it's possible i simply didn't find it among the dozens of posts i'd make or reblog daily.</p>
          <p>i was at first too scared to properly start role-playing, so instead i began to make photo edits of the Dark Doctor, in a similar manner to the author themself: using promotional photos of the Tenth Doctor (or David Tennant in other roles) and greyscaling </p>
