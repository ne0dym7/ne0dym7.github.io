          <p><b>17/08/2024</b>: Exciting new front page update!</p>
          <p><b>10/08/2024</b>: I meant to update yesterday, but I got lazy. Here it is though!</p>
          <p><b>02/08/2024</b>: Finally, the first proper front page update in a while, with new featured music! In retrospect I quite enjoyed CH and I'm not super thrilled to be back in Brazil, but next week school starts and it's likely to be my last semester!!</p>
          <p><b>26/07/2024</b>: This is my last update in Switzerland! I had more fun here since the last update, but there's still one big thing to do: a military band show in Basel, later today!</p>
          <p><b>19/07/2024</b>: Whenever I update late I try to make the next one 6 days later so that it eventually goes back to normal, which is supposed to be Friday, but I decided to do it now to get it out of the way! Switzerland is quite nice. Hasn't been all perfect but I'm enjoying it overall.</p>
          <p><b>14/07/2024</b>: Front page update is here, with a repeat song section again but new movie! My flight is tomorrow, and I'm hoping I can do some work on the website while I'm away. Good news, I passed the goddamned Organic Chemistry class!</p>
          <p><b>08/07/2024</b>:I've been hard at work (in FFXIV), so I really have not had any time to work on this site! And next Monday I leave for my Switzerland trip and will be away for 2 weeks without my computer, so I'll re-use some of the old featured music.</p>
          <p><b>02/07/2024</b>: Well as expected update is a few days late! I spent the weekend playing FFXIV and studying for my last exam. School is over for now, but new FFXIV expansion is just beginning!</p>
          <p><b>22/06/2024</b>: Front page update is here! My classes are finishing one by one, but the new FFXIV expansion drops in a week, so I expect to be quite busy next weekend.</p>
          <p><b>15/06/2024</b>: Front page update! This time I didn't forget, haha.</p>
          <p><b>08/06/2024</b>: OMG, I keep forgetting to update! I can't help it though, it's just that having partner here and hanging out and watching stuff really takes me away from my computer.</p>
          <p><b>01/06/2024</b>: Since last week's update was late, I'm updating now on Saturday!</p>
          <p><b>26/05/2024</b>: I totally missed update day but it's because my partner has come to visit!!</p>
          <p><b>17/05/2024</b>: New blog post, finally! Also, front page update.</p>
          <p><b>10/05/2024</b>: Had a very busy week, but front page update is here!</p>
          <p><b>03/05/2024</b>: Sadly my blog posts aren't ready yet, but front page update as usual! Also, re-ordered archived media in music and movies, from newest to oldest.</p>
          <p><b>26/04/2024</b>: Front page update and hoping to have some more free time after this week.</p>
          <p><b>19/04/2024</b>: Front page update! I'm working on more blog posts but haven't had much time lately. I'm not giving up though!</p>
          <p><b>11/04/2024</b>: Front page update is a little early this time as I won't be able to do it tomorrow!</p>
          <p><b>06/04/2024</b>: Classes returned so I haven't had much time to update! So Friday update is a little late, but it brings new music and movie, along with CSS adjustments. There were also a couple of blog posts within the past week!</p>
          <p><b>29/03/2024</b>: Friday is front page update day, and here's the first update! New featured music and movie. Also, imported another tumblr post for the blog. Decided to add quotes for featured movies, they are included in the main page as an overlay.</p>
          <p><b>27/03/2024</b>: Added the page for my OC Fyodor! Including images and old text about him. There's also a transparent Fyodor on his page.</p>
          <p><b>26/03/2024</b>: Added a transparent Harrow that replaces bottom right Neo in some places. Also finally added a page for a blog, it already has a couple of posts!</p>
          <p><b>25/03/2024</b>: Added more Neos to the layout and tweaked the front page a bit! Also added a right sidebar with buttons. Adjustments in css and javascript to accomodate those additions. Finally, made the website a fixed width and centered on the window. Did this for better placement of bottom right Neo.</p>
          <p><b>24/03/2024</b>: Added the page for my OC Harrow! Including images and an embed of my carrd page.</p>
          <p><b>23/03/2024</b>: Added the Featured Music section and archive page. Also added this changelog, which means the website is oficially launched, I guess?! Made content background white again, and created a bunch of styles in CSS for inserted sections, such as this one! Added a Featured film section and archive page. </p>
