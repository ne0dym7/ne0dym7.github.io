        <h1>About the website</h1>
        
        <p>Long ago, the ne0dym was a chronic tumblr and twitter user. I would say absolutely everything that came to mind, chronicle my day-to-day life, publish my creations, connect with fellow fans, and share posts about my favourite things. Over the past few years, however, a significant drop in quality in social network websites, along with other unrelated factors, has driven me away from these online spaces.</p>
        <p>So it is that I've created this website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To escape the algorithm-based, AI-ridden, hate-filled echo chambers and hive minds of corporate-owned platforms.</li>
          <li>To dump my thoughts, archive creations and tell stories.</li>
          <li>To share things that I like.</li>
          <li>To explore a new medium and learn new things.</li>
        </ul>
        
         <p>This website has been designed with desktop and fairly large screens in mind. I have yet to figure out how to make it responsive. Pages with a lot of images may take a while to fully load (including the sidebar). If viewing on mobile or tablet, make sure to use landscape view, or everything's gonna be too squished to read! Javascript is used to create the sidebars.</p>
         <p>While the website was originally hosted on Neocities, I took the decision to move it to Github in order to use the custom domain, due to costs. Despite the fancy URL, everything's staying the same!</p>
