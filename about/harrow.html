        <p>Harrow is my Warrior of Light (WoL) in Final Fantasy XIV. My first contact with the game was in 2017, but it took until August of 2020 for me to finally get sucked into the critically acclaimed MMO. The pandemic made sure I was staying inside all day, and with my classes being online (of course I played while I had Zoom on another monitor, haha) I had so much time to play through the main story, level up my character, unlock new features and connect with other players.</p>
        <p>The main thing that attracted me was the Dark Knight questline, which I had spoiled myself for in anticipation. So when I created my character I had a strong motivation to finish the base game and head into the first expansion in order to unlock the class, ensuring that I would stick with the game this time around. In the beginning, I wasn't very clear on what I wanted my character's backstory to be, so he had a different surname, which is no longer canon.</p>
        <p>Eventually, as I progressed through the game and had more ideas, I arrived at his definitive backstory. In June 2021, I changed his name: <b>Harrow Lévesque</b>. A Miqo'te who, orphaned at a young age, was taken in by an Ishgardian Elezen family and raised as one of their own. Devoted to the goddess Halone and determined to enter the Holy See of Ishgard, his journey would lead him to meet the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and defeat the enemies of Eorzea, ascending as the Warrior of Light with the power granted by the enigmatic Hydaelyn.</p>
        <p>Harrow has several unique physical traits that differ from the in-game models. At the top of the page and down below are some of my drawings, showing my vision for his current design! The screenshots do not accurately depict his appearance, they're only meant to showcase his different outfits throughout the expansions; the last image shows Elezen!Harrow, as I actually play as that race.</p>
        <p>Harrow is known for being extremely tall (for a Miqo'te) and having facial hair in Elezen style instead of Keeper of the Moon markings; in fact, his whole body language resembles that of an Elezen, influenced by his upbringing. He speaks with an Ishgardian accent (reminiscent of real-life Québecois) and has a chivalrous, reserved demeanour. In battle, his faith in the goddess of war and the power bestowed by Hydaelyn grant him ferocity to protect his allies with his own life.</p>
