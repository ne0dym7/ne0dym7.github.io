        <h1>About me!</h1>

        <p>I'm neo. I'm 25, they/them, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡§.</p>
        <p>I am pursuing a B.Sc. in Chemistry, graduating in December/24. At the moment I don't really have any projects outside of university and can usually be found playing videogames. My goal once I finish school is to move in with my partner in MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec!</p>
        <p>I used to draw & write quite a bit, but for the past few years I have not been very creative. Perhaps this website will give me some motivation to return to creative pursuits?</p>
        <p>Here's some mildly interesting facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm learning French! I previously studied Japanese and German, and have been interested in several other languages.</li>
          <li>I love to get stoned and frequently consume weed in edible form!</li>
          <li>I started and dropped degrees in Materials Engineering and International Relations, so I've been in university for way too long!</li>
          <li>I have a few prized collections: CD's and DVD's of my favourite artists, action figures of tokusatsu characters, some manga series, magazines and books in Japanese, and several copies of <i>The Little Prince</i> in various languages!</li>
          <li>For a while I played the bass and trained Karate! I've been out of practice at both.</li>
          <li>Tigers and cats are my favourite animals! I have two cats, and a tiger tattoo on my forearm!</li>
        </ul>
