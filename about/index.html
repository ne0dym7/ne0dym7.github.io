        <h1>About me!</h1>

        <p>I'm neo. I'm 26, they/them, 🇧🇷🇨🇭.</p>
        <p>I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry and am interested in a wide variety of fields such as science, art, music, games and linguistics. I love to learn new things and sometimes I embark on creative pursuits too!</p>
        <p>I've just moved to Montréal, Québec with my partner, and we're currently looking into how I can permanently immigrate!</p>
        <p>Here are some neo facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm learning French! I previously studied Japanese and German, and have been interested in several other languages.</li>
          <li>I love to get stoned and frequently consume weed in edible form!</li>
          <li>I started and dropped degrees in Materials Engineering and International Relations before committing to Chemistry, so I spent way too much time at university!</li>
          <li>I have a few prized collections: CD's and DVD's of my favourite artists, action figures of tokusatsu characters, some manga series, magazines and books in Japanese, and several copies of <i>The Little Prince</i> in various languages!</li>
          <li>For a while I played the bass and trained Karate! I've been out of practice at both.</li>
          <li>Tigers are my favourite animals and I have a tiger tattoo on my forearm!</li>
          <li>Me and my partner have a cat son, named Leo, and I also have another kitty, named Casimira, who stayed in Brazil with my mom. Our first cat, Claire, left us in December 2025. I miss them every day!</li>
        </ul>
