        <p>While I was only into Twisted Wonderland for a few months back in 2020, my TWST OC had a pretty big impact on my creative output during that time and even influenced the design of my next OC in FFXIV! Named <b>Fyodor Weiss</b>, he is a white tiger animalfolk who transferred from Savanaclaw dorm to Octavinelle.</p>
        <p>The idea for this character came from my own experience playing the game, at first drawn to Savanaclaw due to The Lion King being one of my favourite things ever, but quickly finding that the characters and aesthetics of Octavinelle were much more appealing to me, even though at the time I had not seen the film it was inspired by. There was also a bit of "fanon" about the three main Octavinelle characters that went into shaping my vision for Fyodor!</p>

        <p>His name originates from "Theodore", rendered in its Russian form "Fyodor"; I thought that, since his animal inspiration is a Siberian tiger, a Russian name would fit well. Initially I wasn't a big fan of this version of the name, but it definitely grew on me! His surname, "Weiss", is simply "white" in German, because he is a white tiger; my idea was that it wouldn't look too out of place in such a game to have names of different origins mixed like that, given how wacky a lot of the characters' names are haha.</p>
        <p>Having been created right in the middle of the pandemic during the height of my creative career, a lot of Fyodor's characteristics were based on myself. I am no longer following TWST and updating Fyodor, but below the gallery I've included both his formal biography and all my rambling tweets I could find about him!</p>

          <p><b>Background</b>: Fyodor was always a shy kid who didn’t want to stand out much. He disliked being forced to do things at school, even if he was good at them; for instance, being of the tiger kin he was naturally strong, but hated P.E. classes because of the sports and teamwork activities. He preferred to learn things on his own and at his own pace, and as such he developed his unique magic as a way of escaping situations he found uncomfortable. Fyodor was also invested in hero shows and films, though he often looked up to the villains instead, whom he found much cooler and more interesting. Much of his introvertedness stemmed from his fear of being rejected because of his interests and nerdiness, which led to a constant feeling of being out of place.</p>
          <p>Although he avoided a good portion of the school activities, he wasn’t averse to authority and had a generally polite disposition. He was quite good at mathematics and science but did poorly at subjects like history and music, despite his best efforts. His magic skills were decent but rarely showcased, as he disliked being in the spotlight. Nevertheless, he was chosen to study at Night Raven College and was quickly sorted into Savanaclaw, as most animalfolk are.</p>
          <p><b>First year</b>: From the beginning Fyodor admired prefect Leona’s way of thinking and doing things, but he didn’t feel very comfortable around the other noisy and sporty students. He felt like he wouldn’t be able to grow as much as he wished as long as he was part of Savanaclaw, but for the time being decided to endure it, as it was his first year and there was still a lot to learn.</p>
          <p>He gradually lost some of his social anxiety by joining the Science club and meeting like-minded nerdy people, but his academic performance remained much the same. He did especially well in Alchemy and even went so far as to sneak into the classroom one day while under the effect of his unique magic and steal some materials so that he could experiment on his own. However, despite gaining confidence and opening up to other people, he still felt out of place in Savanaclaw, and resolved to transfer at the beginning of the second year.</p>
          <p><b>Second year</b>: Out of the six other dorms, Fyodor thought Octavinelle was the coolest and soon decided to try and win the prefect’s approval. First he communicated to Leona his intention of transferring, to which the senior demonstrated his usual apathy but also an understanding of his frustrations. Then, Fyodor approached Azul and expressed interest in joining Octavinelle as he believed the dorm was the most suitable to help his skills flourish or whatever (in reality it was more because he thought it was dope as hell). Azul wasn’t entirely convinced but also wouldn’t just turn down a potential business associate and thus allowed Fyodor to prove his worth by employing him at Mostro Lounge.</p>
          <p>For about two weeks Fyodor did all sorts of tasks at the restaurant, finding aptitude for accounting and other administrative functions. One evening, while taking a stroll around the campus, invisible and off duty, he happened upon the Leech twins intimidating a student for not paying a debt, using some questionable methods that he really wasn’t supposed to know about. Rather than being scared, Fyodor found himself even more excited to be part of that sophisticated mafia-like business. He recorded that moment on his phone and, a few days later, confronted his bosses about it.</p>
          <p>At first, the three denied the existence of any dishonest business practices, but were forced to acknowledge the newcomer’s stealth abilities when he showed the video as proof. Fyodor quickly clarified that he didn’t mean to out them, on the contrary, he wished to join them. Azul and the twins deliberated for a moment and determined that he could be a useful asset, finally welcoming him into Octavinelle and Mostro Lounge.</p>
          <p>Fyodor is now a resident of Octavinelle, working under Jade and Floyd (who is in the same class as him) and performing some undercover missions of his own. His abilities have been especially useful in identifying and tracking down debtors, whose names he then relays to Azul and the twins.</p>

        <div class="inserts" style="height: 200px;">
          <ul>
            <li>i said i’d make an oc: they got sorted into savanaclaw but then decided they wanted to be gangsta not a jock so they transferred to octavinelle. tigers are good at swimming after all</li>
            <li>i thought about this some more. he liked leona and ruggies way of doing things but thought the students were in the way with their jockness and he wasn't finding much fulfilment being in a dorm so oriented towards sports. as a tiger he's kind of a loner</li>
            <li>he's good at maths and alchemy, sucks at history and is ok at PE but he skips class often bc he finds it cumbersome. he has a unique magic that turns him invisible (though it gives him blot if using for too long) and uses it to copy people's homework</li>
            <li>he approaches azul one day and says he's interested in transferring as he thinks his talents are wasted in savanaclaw. he gets a job at mostro lounge to prove his skills before azul allows him to transfer properly, and he does well as an accountant but terribly as a waiter</li>
            <li>he becomes interested in the shady side of the business once, while invisible, he accidentally witnesses the twins collecting a debt. initially the bosses deny it but he shows them pictures he took with his phone and they go silent for a moment. he thinks he's done for</li>
            <li>but the oct boys are impressed with how dedicated he's been and think his stealth skills could be very useful. he's finally accepted into octavinelle and studies yakuza business tacticts under the twins</li>
            <li>my first idea for a name was klaus, as i'm a sucker for this name, but it had to be a russian name because tiger -> siberia, then i thought about theodore but i didn't like the russian variation at first but it's growing on me now. fyodor...</li>
            <li>i thought very hard of a surname but in the end i settled for weiss, a german name, because it just sounded so like twisted wonderland to mix languages like that lmao.</li>
            <li>who else would fyodor get along with, definitely idia bc they're both nerds with social anxiety. or maybe he runs into malleus one evening and they bond over being loners though for different reasons</li>
            <li>i think he can be sorta buddies with leona as big cats who slack off, maybe they meet again when fyodor's already fully settled in octa and looks much more comfortable and leona is like hmph. as long as you're having a good time. cause deep down he cares for his juniors</li>
            <li>trying to think of an ideal voice for fyodor and instantly forgetting every single seiyuu i know</li>
            <li>on a related note, i researched character speech styles in japanese fiction and couldn't decide on a tone for him so i guess he uses fairly standard polite speech and when he's being moody it gets progressively casual until he's had enough and goes invisible</li>
            <li>i think it would be cute if he had a gobi like ガオ at the end of his sentences though.....</li>
            <li>i'll need to examine everyone's speech styles to see if i can find an appropriate one, but for now i think the range is somewhere inbetween azul levels of politeness and floyd levels of rowdiness. he starts drawling and rolling his r's when he's tired of dealing with people</li>
            <li>while writing down his lore it was important for me to establish that he isn't a delinquent, he's just a tad withdrawn and doesn't like being the centre of people's attention. incidentally this is why you never see him in the game,</li>
            <li>he does have an adventurous side though like he enjoys fantasy and exploring and being part of the ocean mafia. the core of his character i think is that he never felt like he belonged anywhere and thus used to avoid everyone and everything but now he's finding himself</li>
            <li>my headcanon is that floyd calls fyodor itachizamechan after the tiger shark</li>
            <li>slowly crafting more lore for my twst oc and had to see if anyone had come up with a canon timeline. it's likely that each month starting from september is one chapter so that gives me some leeway to do what i want and be canon compliant...</li>
            <li>i'm thinking fyodor wasted no time putting the dorm transfer plan into action as soon as the school year started. so he could already have been part of the gang by the time the octas started doing shady business around the magift tournament (sometime in october)</li>
            <li>reading the side stories made me realise that the world of twisted wonderland, surprise, runs on villain logic, so it's perfectly appropriate that fyodor would want to join the stylish bad guys just because</li>
            <li>i feel like i need to establish a stronger motivation though. this is what i had in mind: hearts: too many rules and parties scara: parties as well pome: beauty = attention which is bad igni: the next best option tbh but he didn't vibe with them diaso: too popular</li>
            <li>in an alternate universe my boy transferred to ignihyde and is even more of a hikikomori, but in this universe he decided he should try and find some purpose in life and that purpose was to be a yakuza lackey</li>
            <li>personally i think he fits well enough. he's smart and inquisitive, both of which are good traits to have when you're helping run a business. he just has issues with being bossed around when he doesn't want to do somthing. but if he's down with it he'll get the job done</li>
            <li>a couple days ago i had an idea for his SSR personal story that was like some guy asks fyodor to steal a contract they made with azul so they can destroy it. naturally, fyodor tells the bosses about it and they devise a plan to punish the guy who wanted to break the rules</li>
            <li>fyodor sees kantokusei and grim doing their antics for the 10th time and sighs and goes back to the restaurant to count madols or something</li>
            <li>azul decides they need a new menu item & entrusts fyodor with the task. my boy is nervous as hes not a cooking person but hes good at alchemy and figures cooking is not so different. he comes up with a pasta recipe inspired by some show he watched (his fav food is ramen remember)</li>
            <li>this is his SR lab coat personal story. see i'm getting the hang of OC lore. you gotta think like the game</li>
            <li>i think i made azul too nice in my oc's backstory so i thought of a twist like what if when fyodor tells azul he knows about the sketchy stuff, azul thinks the headmaster sent him to sabotage the business and is like, whatever crowley is paying you i will double it</li>
            <li>and fyodor is puzzled for a moment but he realises, does azul think i came here to extort him and is trying to out-extort me?? and then he says nooo i don't want to ruin your business i want to join it because i think i could be of use to you</li>
            <li>the inspiration for fyodor’s hair was, surprisingly, 9S - then i added the side tufts and sideburns and i always seem to gravitate towards ahoges too. later i realised i just made him into haise tokyo ghoul</li>
            <li>i believe the correct octa pairing is a big poly which is why my oc gets to join in too</li>
            <li>look i can see 🦈 going aha♡, tiger sharkie is cute~, and playing with his tail and ears, and they have a similar personality in some aspects so they keep enabling each other too. 🐬 has to intervene because they just decided to skip a whole days classes</li>
            <li>i don't actually know how fyodors sideburns would work in reality. this is a world where animal folk exist so i think you can exercise some suspension of disbelief</li>
            <li>fyodor's aversion to anything requiring cooperation is a metaphor for my zoom breakout room struggles</li>
            <li>i love my oc because he really was just born from the premise that mostrolounge is a mafia restaurant and i wanted to play with the concept</li>
            <li>my idea for overblot fyodor was like his power is invisibility so i imagined him turning partially incorporeal sort of like harrow's deluxe skin and nearly fading out of existence. after the incident he learns that he can't hide from the world forever</li>
            <li>on his unique magic, it's not actually true invisibility - as the name suggests, it's an illusion that makes other people not register his presence. it's tuned so as to work even on people with acute eyesight such as animal folk but won't work on magical beings</li>
            <li>a slightly more adventurous idea was that, since i established that fyodor is pretty good at alchemy, obviously, he starts making and selling drugs to vip patrons</li>
            <li>fuck i just remembered i gotta draw the banana cat meme with fyodor that was the whole reason i made it his least fav food sfkgbdndbsnsn</li>
            <li>not the whole reason bc he’s just me projecting and i also hate bananas (and fruit in general)</li>
            <li>i imagine fyodor witnessed a scene like that rt fanart and just got super h*rny and that's why he went i Must join these guys</li>
            <li>do you think fyodor speaks the in universe equivalent of russian when he's angry</li>
            <li>thinkin bout how the beast societies in twst are analogous to their source counterparts and thus fyodor was probably raised by his mum and left home at an early age</li>
            <li>in fact, that's where i got the idea that he likes solitude and his ability is invisibility, tigers are solitary and reclusive animals that avoid confrontations if possible</li>
            <li>fuck i remembered that after seeing a certain art last night i had this idea that maybe fyodor, for all that he was excited to be a gangsta, was really shocked when he actually got his first kill (as a sidenote i don't believe they do kill anyone so let's just say</li>
            <li>they badly maim their victims) + his 2 mentors praising him and f giving a big hug and j saying he did really well, and the dissonance between terrified and shocked fyodor hyperventilating and clinging to f and the twins congratulating and soothing him is just so sexy hhhgnn</li>
            <li>if fyodor drinks azul's turn into merman potion does he turn into a tiger shark or turn into a tiger furry or turn into an actual tiger</li>
            <li>i came up with some relatively unimportant details just as flavour but one of the most endearing things about fyodor to me is that i made him an accountant. i love picturing him counting money and making spreadsheets</li>
            <li>i think it would be poetic cinema if fyodors favourite hero show (aka toku) had similarities with his own eventual hero's (villain's) journey</li>
            <li>fyodor might not be a giant like the eels but he can turn up behind someone out of thin air like 'heard you were talkin shit about mr ashengrotto'</li>
