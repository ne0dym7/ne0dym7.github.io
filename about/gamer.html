        <h1>Gamer Neo!</h1>
        
        <p>Since October 2021, I have a gaming PC which is my main videogame machine. It's due for an upgrade at some point! This is my setup:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>CPU</b>: AMD Ryzen 7 5700G</li>
          <li><b>GPU</b>: Gigabyte NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060</li>
          <li><b>RAM</b>: 16GB</li>
          <li><b>Motherboard</b>: Gigabyte B550M DS3H</li>
          <li><b>Displays</b>: Gigabyte M27Q (27", 2K); LG 29WL500 (29", Ultrawide FHD)</li>
          <li><b>Mouse</b>: Logitech G600</li>
          <li><b>Keyboard</b>: Keychron C2 (Brown switches)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My secondary videogame machine is my Playstation 5, which I got in July 2023. It replaced my PS4 Slim, my platform of choice until I got my PC! In the past, I played on handheld consoles: Nintendo DS Lite and DSi, Playstation Vita 2nd-gen, and New Nintendo 3DS XL.</p>
        <p><b>Final Fantasy XIV</b> has been my obsession since August of 2020 when I created my third and current character, Harrow Lévesque. On this character alone I have well over 6300 hours of playtime. While I originally got into the game thanks to its story and characters, nowadays I am a "raider" and have completed most of the currently relevant hardcore content! Although lately I find the story hasn't been as interesting as before, I still have a lot of care for Harrow, having created an extensive story for him. In fact, he has <a href="..\about/harrow.html">his own page</a>! <mark>IGN: Harrow Levesque, at Gilgamesh</mark>.</p>
        <p>I've also played a lot of <b>Warframe</b>, having got back into the game with the coming of account cross-save. My main is Harrow (in fact, that is how my FFXIV character got his name) but I've been having fun with other frames I've unlocked recently as well. I don't do any of the hardcore content, preferring to just chill in endless survival missions and occasionally grind for new stuff. <mark>IGN: ne0dym-02 on PC, ne0dym-01 on PS5</mark>.</p>
        <p>I recently finished a campaign in <b>Baldur's Gate 3</b> with my friends Jim and Athena! It's always a blast playing with them, and I've written a blog post about our adventures! My character in that playthrough was Tomscot, a College of Swords Bard who wears a red shirt and travels around with his new friends, looking for interesting things to put on his channel.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some games and series I've enjoyed a lot over the years (finished or not):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Final Fantasy XIV, XV, XVI</li>
          <li>Warframe</li>
          <li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
          <li>Danganronpa</li>
          <li>NieR: Automata</li>
          <li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
          <li>Elden Ring</li>
          <li>Deep Rock Galactic</li>
          <li>World of Warcraft</li>
